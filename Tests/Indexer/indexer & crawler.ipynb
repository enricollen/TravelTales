(AP) — With the calendar-page turn to 2024 on Monday comes 320 new state laws that Illinois residents will need to navigate. Some will have a widespread effect, including a law banning semi-automatic rifles and another requiring paid time off. But others won’t have an immediate or noticeable impact, including a law that lets county governments consider a potential contractor’s participation in an approved apprenticeship program in determining the winning low bid for a project. Advertisement One law that took effect in 2019 but is still impacting tens of thousands of workers is an  increase in the minimum wage . It increases to $14 an hour on Jan. 1 for non-tipped workers and will reach $15 in a year. Here are some of the other major changes to Illinois state law as of New Year’s Day: BAN ON SEMI-AUTOMATIC WEAPONS The  U.S. Supreme Court has failed  to take up the case of Illinois’ ban on the sale, possession or manufacture of automatic weapons like the type used in a  mass shooting at a 2023  July Fourth  parade  in the Chicago suburb of Highland Park. The law bans dozens of specific brands or types of rifles and handguns, including .50-caliber guns, attachments and rapid-firing devices. No rifle will be allowed to accommodate more than 10 rounds, with a 15-round limit for handguns. Those who previously purchased such guns must register them with the Illinois State Police by Jan. 1. Advertisement BOOK-BAN PROHIBITION Libraries that  indiscriminately ban books will not be eligible for state funds . They must adopt the American Library Association’s Library Bill of Rights stating “materials should not be excluded because of the origin, background, or views of those contributing to their creation.” The library association reported that attempts to censor books reached a 20-year high in 2022, especially those with LGBTQ+ themes and those written by people of color. PAID TIME OFF Employers will be  required to offer paid vacation  for any reason. Workers will accrue one hour of paid leave for every 40 hours worked, up to 40 hours total. Employers may offer more than 40 hours and employees may take time off after working for 90 days. AIR FRESHENERS ALLOWED Police will no longer be able to pull over a motorist solely because there is an object hanging from their rearview mirror. The law was approved after  Daunte Wright was pulled over in Minnesota in 2021  for having a dangling air freshener. He was shot when the officer, reaching for her stun gun, instead grabbed her sidearm. NO VIDEOCONFERENCING ON THE ROAD Video meetings, streaming or accessing a social media website while driving will be prohibited. There will be an exception for video on a hands-free or voice-activated device or an application requiring the push of no more than a single button to activate or terminate it. Advertisement NO INDOOR VAPING Vaping or smoking an electronic cigarette or cigar in a public indoor space will be prohibited. The law adds electronic smoking devices to the list of items prohibited in indoor public places under the 2008 Smoke Free Illinois Act, which banned regular tobacco products’ indoor use. LICENSE-PLATE READER RESTRICTIONS Interstate agreements between law enforcement agencies must specify that  license-plate reader technology not be used on cars driven by women  coming into Illinois to have abortions. SURVEILLANCE DRONES Following the Highland Park parade shooting, lawmakers approved the use of drones by law enforcement to surveil “routed” or “special events.” The drones may not be equipped with weapons or facial-recognition technology.

Centcom said while the ships were responding to the distress call, two anti-ship missiles were fired from Houthi-controlled areas at the pair of US navy vessels. The USS Gravely destroyed the inbound ballistic missiles, Centcom said, adding it was the twenty-third \"illegal attack by the Houthis on international shipping\" since 19 November. Centcom added the Maersk Hangzhou is \"reportedly seaworthy and there are no reported injuries\" on board.

In a statement, the organisation said an unidentified ship had reported \"a loud bang accompanied by a flash on the port bow of the vessel\" and several explosions. The rise in Houthi attacks over several weeks has led to many shipping firms diverting their vessels away from the Red Sea, travelling around the horn of Africa instead. To reach the Suez Canal in Egypt - which connects to the Mediterranean Sea - ships must pass through the tiny Bab al-Mandab Strait, just off the coast of Houthi-controlled areas in Yemen. The Tehran-sponsored rebels have previously claimed to only target \"Israel-linked\" commercial ships in response to the war in Gaza, saying the attacks are an attempt to stop Israeli attacks on Palestinians. Watch: Yemen's Houthis released video in November showing armed men dropping from a helicopter and seizing a cargo ship In response, the US launched Operation Prosperity Guardian - an international coalition to safeguard shipping in the the region. In an interview with the Associated Press, US Navy Vice Admiral Brad Cooper said the Houthis do not seem to be ending their \"reckless\" attacks in light of the maritime taskforce. He added that 1,200 commercial ships have passed through the Red Sea since the operation was launched, with none hit by drone or missile strikes until Saturday. Maersk said last week that it was preparing to resume journeys through Red Sea - after diverting to the much longer route around the Cape of Good Hope because of recent Houthi attacks on shipping. The Red Sea is one of the world's most important shipping lanes as it links markets in Europe with Asia. Analysts have warned the attacks could see a rise in prices, as it is also one of the most important routes for oil and liquefied natural gas shipments produced in the Middle East.

She soon proved them wrong. Ellie went on to make history as the first model with the condition to feature on the front cover of Vogue. Now aged 22, she has just bought her own home in Essex and recently published a book about her life, called Against All Odds. Here, in their own words, the model and her mother Yvonne explain how Ellie has been defying expectations since the day she was born. Yvonne's story Ellie was diagnosed with Down's syndrome at birth and her parents were told she needed heart surgery When Ellie was born, we were shocked to learn she had Down's syndrome. The doctors said she would never walk or talk and a nurse suggested we might want to leave her at the hospital. I struggled to accept her diagnosis and bond with her.  We were told Ellie needed heart surgery so I was really nervous about getting close to her. When she was five months old, she had a 10-hour operation to close holes in her heart. She spent 10 days in intensive care and another week in the high dependency unit. After three weeks, we were able to take her home and her cheeky and determined personality began to shine through. My husband and I decided to bring her up as Ellie first and put the fact that she has got Down's syndrome to one side. Ellie's picture became the most-liked post on Gucci Beauty's Instagram account Despite what the doctors said, she could walk by 18 months, was speaking by her third birthday and was able to read by the time she started school. Ellie stayed in mainstream education until it came to doing her exams and we moved her to a specialist school.  When she was a teenager, we decided to tell Ellie that she had Down's syndrome. We were nervous about her reaction and showed her a special book but she kept saying, \"I don't look like that. I'm me.\" I was worried it would knock her confidence, but it didn't. Yvonne says Ellie has always had a love of reading and she has got a good memory, which is great for learning monologues and scripts at her perfoming arts college One day my friend told me about a new talent agency called Zebedee, which wanted to work with people with disabilities and visible differences, so I decided to apply for Ellie. Not long after joining, Ellie was chosen to star in Superdrug's Christmas advert in 2018. Her career really took off from there. My mum always used to say, \"She's definitely going to be someone one day.\" She is very headstrong and feisty but that's what makes her Ellie. Ellie Goldstein has been modelling for five years Ellie still really shocks me, she just loves the camera and the attention, I can just see how much she enjoys it and loves it and that makes it all worthwhile.  Ellie recently bought her own home with the proceeds from her modelling but we don't know if she will ever be able to live alone. We are living alongside her for now, though we have kept our family home, and we are trying to encourage her to be more independent but she is still very vulnerable.  We have to prepare her for how she will cope one day when we're not around. Her older sister Amy will obviously look out for her but we would never put that full responsibility on her.  I hope attitudes towards Down's syndrome have changed since Ellie was born but there is still a lot of ignorance. Often in the street, people ask me questions about Ellie and don't address her. They don't realise she can talk and how big a personality she has. Ellie's story Ellie modelled for the adaptive clothing brans Unhidden during London Fashion Week I always wanted to be a model but I didn't see anyone who looked like me on magazine covers so I wasn't sure if I could do it but now I am living my dream. I didn't realise I would be famous one day but I have so much fun dressing up and wearing beautiful dresses. I did three catwalks at London Fashion Week this year and they were brilliant. Looking back at this year, there have been so many good things, but the best bit was probably when my book was published. I was so proud and really excited. I thought, \"Wow it's my own book, I can actually read it.\" This year I have also been filming for a Channel 4 documentary all about my agency, which is going on TV next year, I can't wait to watch it.  I'm in my last year of performing arts college now and I really want to carry on modelling and acting when I leave. I never get nervous. I'm very confident and very cheeky.  Ellie made history as the first person with Down's syndrome to feature on the cover of Vogue When I did the Vogue shoot, I didn't know if my photo was going to be on the cover. My favourite teachers were there when I found out, I was at college, and I was crying and screaming. My friends said \"we love you\" and \"we are proud of you\" and \"well done\". The first Barbie with Down's syndrome came out earlier this year and they asked me to do a photoshoot. I felt honoured and proud. When I saw the doll I thought \"Oh my god, I love it.\" It was great to see a doll that looks like me. Ellie said she was honoured and proud to be able to show off the new Barbie doll to the world My absolute favourite thing in the world is dancing. One day I would love to be on Strictly Come Dancing. I went to watch it being filmed a few weeks ago, but I didn't want to be in the audience, I wanted to be on the dancefloor!  I've just bought a new house and I can't wait for Christmas. I love spending time with my nephew who is two and opening lots of presents. I love being his aunty and I give him lots of cuddles. I am proving people wrong and I am a role model for people like me. Doctors said I wouldn't talk but now I never stop talking! You should always believe in yourself. One day I want to model in New York on a red carpet and on a catwalk.  Never give up on your hopes and dreams, be who you are and always be happy. Just go out there and rock it.

Since Operation Prosperity Guardian was announced just over 10 days ago, 1,200 merchant ships have traveled through the Red Sea region, and none had been hit by drone or missile strikes, Vice Adm. Brad Cooper said in an Associated Press interview, although the U.S. military said that one ship reported being struck by a missile late Saturday. Advertisement Cooper said earlier that day that additional countries are expected to sign on to the mission. Denmark was the latest, announcing Friday it plans to send a frigate to the mission that Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin announced during a visit to Bahrain, where the Navy’s 5th Fleet is based, saying that “this is an international challenge that demands collective action.” The  Iran-backed Houthis , who say their attacks are aimed at Israel-linked ships in an effort to stop the  Israeli offensive in Gaza , fired on the same container ship in  two separate incidents  over the weekend, drawing a U.S. military response. The narrow Bab el-Mandeb Strait connects the Gulf of Aden to the Red Sea and then the Suez Canal. The crucial trade route links markets in Asia and Europe. The seriousness of the attacks, several of which have  damaged vessels,  led multiple  shipping companies  to order their vessels to hold in place and not enter the strait until the security situation improved. Some major shippers were sending their ships around Africa and the Cape of Good Hope, adding time and costs to the journeys. Currently there are five warships from the United States, France, and the United Kingdom patrolling the waters of the southern Red Sea and the western Gulf of Aden, said Cooper, who heads the 5th Fleet. Since the operation started, the ships have shot down a total of 17 drones and four anti-ship ballistic missiles, he said.

The fourth boat fled the area. No damage to U.S. personnel or equipment was reported. There have been about two dozen attacks on international shipping by the Houthis since Oct. 19. Austin discussed the situation with the Dutch defense minister, Kajsa Ollongren, and they condemned the attacks as unacceptable and “profoundly destabilizing” to international order and global commerce, the Pentagon said Saturday. The U.S. has said that more than 20 nations are participating in the security mission, but a number of those nations have not acknowledged it publicly. “I expect in the coming weeks we’re going to get additional countries,” Cooper said, noting Denmark’s recent announcement.

An international task force had been set up in April 2022 to improve maritime security in the region. But Cooper said Operation Prosperity Guardian has more ships and a persistent presence to assist vessels. Since the operation started, the Houthis have stepped up their use of anti-ship ballistic missiles, Cooper said. “We are cleareyed that the Houthi reckless attacks will likely continue,” he said. The Houthis seized Yemen’s capital, Sanaa, in 2014, launching a grinding war against a Saudi-led coalition that sought to restore the government. The militants have sporadically targeted ships in the region, but the attacks increased since the start of the  Israel-Hamas war . The Houthi threatened to attack any vessel they believe is either going to or coming from Israel. That has escalated to apparently any vessel, with  container ships and oil tankers  flagged to countries such as Norway and Liberia being attacked or  drawing missile fire . Advertisement The shipping company Maersk had announced earlier that it had decided to re-route its ships that have been paused for days outside the strait and Red Sea, and send them around Africa instead.  Maersk announced Dec. 25  that it was going to resume sending ships through the strait, citing the operation. Cooper said another shipping company had also resumed using the route. “Commerce is definitely flowing,” Cooper said. ___ Associated Press writer Lolita C.

Brad Cooper said in an Associated Press interview, although the U.S. military said that one ship reported being struck by a missile late Saturday. The crucial trade route links markets in Asia and Europe. Two Navy destroyers responded to the call for help, and the Denmark-owned vessel was reportedly seaworthy and no injuries were noted, according to a statement from U.S. Central Command. Hours later, four Houthi boats fired at the same ship and tried to board, Central Command said. There have been about two dozen attacks on international shipping by the Houthis since Oct. 19. The U.S. has said that more than 20 nations are participating in the security mission, but a number of those nations have not acknowledged it publicly. “I expect in the coming weeks we’re going to get additional countries,” Cooper said, noting Denmark’s recent announcement. Advertisement Cooper said the coalition is in direct communication with commercial ships to provide guidance on “maneuvering and the best practices to avoid being attacked,” and working closely with the shipping industry to coordinate security. But Cooper said Operation Prosperity Guardian has more ships and a persistent presence to assist vessels. “We are cleareyed that the Houthi reckless attacks will likely continue,” he said. That has escalated to apparently any vessel, with  container ships and oil tankers  flagged to countries such as Norway and Liberia being attacked or  drawing missile fire . Advertisement The shipping company Maersk had announced earlier that it had decided to re-route its ships that have been paused for days outside the strait and Red Sea, and send them around Africa instead. Cooper said another shipping company had also resumed using the route. ___ Associated Press writer Lolita C. Baldor in Washington contributed to this report.

Originally a content site for the Dollar Shave Club, Mel was <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/02/insider/what-were-reading.html\">once</a> “the rare men’s magazine that has taken upon itself to investigate masculinity, not enforce it.”</p><div>Advertisement</div><p>Oren Katzeff, CEO of Literally Media, told HuffPost that he wanted to acquire Mel for its unique voice and a loyal audience.</p><p>“I’m a sucker for a good brand,” Katzeff said. “And we hold a deep amount of respect for the voice that Mel had and the audience that it had, and that’s what led to success from a brand standpoint. When you make an acquisition like this, you have to be very respectful of that while also thinking about how to expand and grow the voice into the next chapter of the brand.”</p><p>Mel doesn’t have an editor-in-chief or any writers yet, but the magazine will start publishing next year.

When you make an acquisition like this, you have to be very respectful of that while also thinking about how to expand and grow the voice into the next chapter of the brand.”</p><p>Mel doesn’t have an editor-in-chief or any writers yet, but the magazine will start publishing next year.

It can be difficult to gauge whether that is true, if shoplifting really is at a high. Some places, like Detroit, have online databases with recent crime statistics, but there is no national database where members of the public can see if retail crime specifically is rising or falling.  The term retailers use to describe merchandise loss is “shrink,” a measure that includes theft from customers but also from employees, lost merchandise and unfulfilled orders. Last week, the National Retail Federation put out a report saying organized retail crime accounted for nearly half of overall shrink. This week,  the group walked it back . Advertisement Our picture of reality is hazy. Flip the channel to  Fox News , though, and the crisis has been portrayed as a dire one. Fox and outlets like The New York Post  dutifully cover   what seems to be   every   dramatic   video   of a robbery   they can get a hold of . They cover  retail executives  who cite an increase in shoplifting as the reason they have ostensibly needed to close stores. They speculate on  involvement by Mexican cartels . They write headlines about elected Republican officials’  calls to hike punitive measures  against shoplifters. HuffPost reached out to Media Matters, a nonprofit watchdog group that specializes in analyzing right-wing media. After looking through a video database of Fox programming over the last five years, Media Matters found a very small number of retail theft mentions between 2019 and 2020 — just 35. Since 2021, however, there has been a huge spike — at least 1,575 mentions of retail theft. The coverage was particularly widespread in the fourth quarter of 2021, the group noted. Media coverage can distort reality, making any issue seem bigger than it is, affecting more people than it really does. Advertisement One recent study offers some clarity: The hype about a national shoplifting crime wave is probably a bit overblown. Data suggests that, unless you live in New York City or a handful of others, shoplifting has been declining over much of the country in the last five years.  Researchers with the Council on Criminal Justice  looked at data  from the Justice Department and local police in 24 large U.S. cities from 2019 through the first half of 2023, choosing places where police had consistently been releasing numbers. They found that New York City’s statistics were skewing the picture so much that if New York is included, retail theft is up 16% nationwide, but if New York is not included, retail theft is down 7% nationwide. Considering how many national outlets are based in New York City, sometimes trends affecting New Yorkers end up having an outsize influence on media coverage. Retail theft has actually been going down in 17 of the 24 cities studied, including San Francisco, Chicago, Seattle, Austin, Denver, Cincinnati and St. Louis. After New York City, Los Angeles and Virginia Beach saw the second- and third-largest increases, respectively. Advertisement The study has its limits: It only includes reported thefts, which are a subset of the actual number of retail thefts. Sometimes incidents are not reported to authorities. Ernesto Lopez, a CCJ research specialist and a co-author of the study, said in a statement on the findings that “far better data from law enforcement and the retail industry is needed to help strengthen our grasp of shoplifting trends.” “For now,” Lopez said, “it’s unclear if the increase is a result of increased shoplifting, increased reporting from businesses to police, or a combination of both.” It’s hard also to tell how much of an effect preventive measures taken by individual stores — locking up merchandise, for example — have had. Adam Gelb, president and CEO of CCJ, told HuffPost that videos of the “smash and grab” thefts at chain retailers are especially effective at influencing public opinion because many viewers can’t help but see a “breakdown of civil standards and social norms.” “These videos are literally worth 1,000 words,” Gelb said.  “Twenty years ago, people probably perceived zero chance of being in a store at a time when a large group of people come in and start to tear the place apart, and now they’re seeing that this kind of thing does happen. And even if it is incredibly rare, they don’t have any tolerance for it at all,” he went on. Advertisement People who work at big retailers also have  their own anecdotes to share  about theft they’ve witnessed. Gelb said that he hoped the CCJ study would show the need for better data to really get a clearer picture.

He allegedly did so again during Abdul’s tenure on “Dance,” which spanned 24 episodes between 2013 and 2016.</p><div>Advertisement</div><p>Abdul also claimed Lythgoe sexually assaulted her assistant and named FremantleMedia North America Inc. and its subsidiary American Idol Productions Inc., as well as 19 Entertainment Inc. and its subsidiary Dance Nation Productions Inc., as co-defendants.</p><p>The defendants were accused under the <a href=\"https://www.fightforsurvivors.com/faqs/how-is-sexual-abuse-defined-in-new-assembly-bill/\">Sexual Abuse and Cover-Up Accountability Act</a>, which allows sexual assault victims to sue, even after the statute of limitations has expired, of sexual assault/battery, sexual harassment, gender violence and negligence.</p><p>Abdul claimed Lythgoe “verbally insulted and belittled her” in a meeting about the “Idol” job in 2001 and called her a “has been.” The suit alleges Abdul was paid less than her male peers and was sexually assaulted a few years into the job.</p><p>The first incident reportedly occurred at a hotel “while on the road” to audition contestants.</p><p>“Lythgoe shoved Abdul against the wall, then grabbed her genitals and breasts, and began shoving his tongue down her throat,” stated the lawsuit, which Rolling Stone reviewed. “Abdul attempted to push Lythgoe away from her.”</p><div>Advertisement</div><p>The filing stated, “When the doors to the elevator opened, Abdul ran out of the elevator and to her hotel room. Abdul quickly called one of her representatives in tears to inform them of the assault.”</p><figure><img src=\"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/65904fbf2200005500ad4198.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale\" /><figcaption>Lythgoe and Abdul at the Primetime Emmy Awards in Los Angeles in 2013.</figcaption><span>Richard Shotwell/Invision/Associated Press</span></figure><p>The second incident occurred in 2015 while Abdul was a judge on “Dance,” after Lythgoe invited Abdul to his home for what she believed was “a professional invitation,” according to the suit. Lythgoe “forced himself on top” of Abdul and “attempted to kiss her,” the filing claimed.</p><p>He then allegedly said, “The two would make an excellent ‘power couple.’”</p><p>Abdul claimed Lythgoe groped her assistant, identified in the suit only as April, that same year. Abdul said she didn’t speak out about these incidents for fear of retaliation and that Lythgoe called her to celebrate “seven years after the statute of limitations had run.”</p><p>Representatives for Lythgoe did not immediately respond to HuffPost’s request for comment.</p><p>The Sexual Abuse and Cover-Up Accountability Act, which offers a three-year window for survivors to file claims that would otherwise be excluded due to the statutes of limitations, officially became law in January 2023.</p><div>Advertisement</div><p><em><span>Need help?

The actor and singer described 2023 as “one of the most transformative, most challenging, and yet happiest and most special years of my life” in a lengthy note shared in an Instagram Story post Friday. Advertisement “i have never felt more pride or joy or love while simultaneously feeling so deeply misunderstood by people who don’t know me, who piece whispers together and make what they want out of me and their assumptions of my life,” Grande wrote. “i have learned how much more important one of those things is than the other.” She went on to note that she’d be “reacting to things that deserve my energy only and removing and protecting myself from things that do not,” but remained noticeably cryptic with regard to specifics.  Though Grande didn’t mention anyone by name, media outlets  were quick  to interpret the post as  her response  to the online frenzy that erupted this summer  amid reports  she’d begun dating actor  Ethan Slater , with whom she co-stars in the forthcoming film adaptation of “Wicked.”  Advertisement News of the relationship broke just days after Grande  split from her ex-husband , Dalton Gomez, after two years of marriage. Though reports of their separation timeline vary, Slater and his ex-wife, Lilly Jay, had maintained the appearance of a committed couple until then. He  reportedly filed  for divorce in late July, shortly after he was romantically linked with Grande.  To date, Grande and Slater have not spoken publicly about their relationship. However, the pair  attended a performance  of Broadway’s “Gutenberg! The Musical!” in November, and happily posed with the show’s stars, Josh Gad and Andrew Rannells, for photos backstage.

In 2020, a report from <a href=\"https://www.experian.com/blogs/ask-experian/survey-some-consumers-would-risk-identity-theft-for-an-online-holiday-deal/\">Experian</a> found that one in four Americans have fallen victim to fraud during the holidays. It’s estimated that <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com/?id=38395X987171&amp;xs=1&amp;xcust=656f6911e4b0dcfcc981c305&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.aarp.org%2Fmoney%2Fscams-fraud%2Finfo-2023%2Fftc-consumer-losses.htm\">millions</a> of people are affected by scams each year.</p><p>Why are we more vulnerable during the holidays to getting scammed? </p><p>Michael Jabbara, the vice president and global head of fraud services for Visa, said the uptick in holiday scams happens for several reasons. One reason is that we tend to spend more money during this time, so the payoff is higher for scammers. And our panicked stress to find loved ones the perfect gift is an advantage to scammers. </p><div>Advertisement</div><p>“Fraudsters really love it when we’re in that heightened emotional state because we tend to make terrible decisions during that time,” he said. “That’s the time they like to strike.”</p><p>To avoid being scammed, it helps to know how fraudsters operate during the holidays. Experts shared the top scams to watch out for this season ― and how to spot them: </p><h2><strong>1. The Charity Scam </strong></h2><p>The holidays are a giving time of year, and scammers like to inundate our inboxes with pleas to donate to seemingly legitimate causes and charities.</p><p>In the AARP survey, more than one in three Americans said they’d received a request for a monetary donation to a charity that felt fraudulent. But often, you may not know the charity was a scam until it’s too late.</p><div>Advertisement</div><p>“A lot of times with charity frauds, victims don’t know that they’re actually a victim,” said Amy Nofziger, the director of victim support for the AARP Fraud Watch Network. “Let’s say you do give money to a charity that you think’s legitimate. You’re not going to necessarily know that it’s not until maybe they get found and prosecuted, and then your name’s on some victims’ list.“</p><p>A key difference between a legitimate charity and one that is not is whether they are pressuring you to donate right away. “Any good, legitimate charity will take your money today, tomorrow, or the next day,” Nofziger said. </p><p>And do your research. Check to see if your money is going to the cause you support by looking it up on sites like <a href=\"https://www.charitynavigator.org/\">Charity Navigator</a> and <a href=\"https://www.charitywatch.org/\">CharityWatch</a>, which will include reviews and company finance information.</p><p>And when you donate, go directly to the charity’s website ― don’t click on a link you got via email or text, as Nofziger recommended. </p><h2><strong>2. The Too-Good-To-Be-True Deal Scam</strong></h2><p>Every year, there are hot-ticket items that sell out around the holidays. Scammers know this and will send victims emails or create a listing on <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/impact/topic/facebook\">Facebook</a> Marketplace with the sneakers or consoles you’ve been hunting for. Only it’s not a legitimate sale.</p><div>Advertisement</div><p>“It takes you to a website that looks eerily similar to the website that you would expect where this good would be sold. You’re very excited about it, you click on the link, and you complete the transaction,” Jabbara said regarding how the scheme typically goes. “But of course, you either don’t receive the goods and now your payment information is exfiltrated.”</p><p>To avoid losing money, do a gut check with yourself about those deals you spot on the internet. Ask yourself, “Does it make sense for me to pay this low of an amount for the good or service that I’m receiving?” Jabbara said. </p><p>Nofziger said it’s a red flag if the seller has every size and color available when any other website is sold out of that item. Even if the seller does send you the sneakers you wanted, she said it might be counterfeit. </p><p>If it’s a seller on Facebook Marketplace, avoid listings that <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/facebook-marketplace-scam-how-to-spot_l_646cda9de4b0005c605c39f3\">only list peer-to-peer payment systems</a> like Venmo, CashApp or Zelle as an option because scammers prefer these untraceable and unretractable forms of payment. Be wary of sellers who refuse to meet in person. </p><h2><strong>3. The Gift Card Scam</strong></h2><p>Those physical gift cards you buy to give as stocking stuffers may not actually have money when you activate them. </p><div>Advertisement</div><p>That’s because scammers are known to tamper with gift cards on display racks and set it up so that <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/gift-card-scam_l_64062700e4b029d870179f72\">when you register to activate them, the scammer will be notified</a> and they can spend or transfer the funds before you or your gift recipient can use it. </p><p>To avoid getting fooled, pick gift cards behind the cashier or online when you have a choice ― those are less likely to be tampered with. And when you do receive gift cards, use them right away to give scammers less time to manipulate them. </p><h2><strong>4. The Holiday Airfare Travel Scam </strong></h2><p>If a holiday deal that feels too good to be true comes through your inbox, be wary. Some scammers impersonate airline customer service agents to get your personal and banking information. </p><p>“They think they’re talking to Delta. They think they’re talking to VRBO, but they’re just talking to an impostor,” Nofziger said. </p><p>Because imposters often make fraudulent airline websites, Nofziger said you should also be wary of clicking airfare links you found via a search engine result and instead should go directly to the airline’s website. </p><div>Advertisement</div><p>Double-check if the airline customer service phone number you found via a search engine is the proper one.</p><p>If you call a fraudulent number, the scammer may try to fool you into giving them a gift card with language like, “We can take care of this problem for you right now. Not a problem. And actually, I can offer you a $50 discount if you can get me an Amex [American Express] gift card because we’re running a special with Amex,” Nofziger said as an example. </p><h2><strong>5. The Malware Merchant Checkout Scam </strong></h2><p>Sometimes, even though the holiday seller is legitimate, the checkout system has been compromised.</p><p>“We’re seeing the injection of malware on merchant checkout pages,” Jabbara said. “So these are legitimate merchants, but they have malicious code on their payment page where you’re entering your payment information at the same time that information is recorded and then exfiltrated out into a malicious infrastructure that’s controlled by these fraudsters.“</p><p>Check if the payment page has secure protocols to transmit your payment data to avoid getting fooled. “If you look at the URL, it should begin with HTTPS, the ‘S’ denoting that it’s using a secure connection to transmit your information,” Jabbara said. </p><p>It also helps to check the seller’s reviews and see if they have had a large number of disputes and chargebacks in the past because that’s a red flag, Jabbara said. </p><div>Advertisement</div><h2><strong>6. The Holiday Shipping Scam</strong></h2><p>During this time of year, you might be waiting for a lot of packages to arrive with your gifts. Under “<a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/smishing-phone-scam_l_6554dd0be4b0998d699e5c0f\">smishing</a>” ― a term that combines “SMS” and “phishing” ― scammers take advantage of this by impersonating delivery and package services to get you to give up personal or bank details. </p><p>“You might get a text message from FedEx or USPS saying that they weren’t able to deliver a package because there was missing information on your account: ‘Just click here to fill the information out, your package will be coming,’” Nofziger said as an example. </p><p>Beyond avoiding suspiciously misspelled text messages, keep track of what you’re buying to know who delivers your package and when. “It can be even on a piece of paper or a notepad or something that says, ‘Purchased this for mom from Nordstrom, expect a ship date at this time,’” Nofziger said. </p><figure><img src=\"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/65722da427000037009c325b.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale\" /><span>10\\'000 Hours via Getty Images</span><figcaption>Shipping scams can be incredibly common during the holidays.</figcaption></figure><h2><strong>What To Do If You’ve Been Scammed </strong></h2><p>The experts stressed that the best way to tackle scams is by preventing yourself from getting defrauded in the first place. But if that’s too late, there are still some steps you can take to limit the damage the scammer has done to your pocketbook: </p><div>Advertisement</div><h3><strong>Call your bank.</strong></h3><p>If you bought a fraudulent purchase with your credit card, call your bank ASAP. “They will carry out an investigation, and if they determine your claim should be valid, you get your money back,” Jabbara said. </p><h3><strong>Your options are more limited if it is with cash or not on a card.</strong></h3><p>“If you’re using a peer-to-peer app or using cash or wire transfer or some of non-card payment method, your recourse is somewhat more limited and undefined,” Jabbara said, noting that whether you get money back will depend on the service’s specific policies, and sometimes “it’s kind of a ‘you’re on your own approach.’”</p><h3><strong>Report the scam to authorities. </strong></h3><p>Help prevent others from getting scammed by filing a complaint with the Federal Trade Commission <a href=\"https://reportfraud.ftc.gov/#/\">online</a> or calling 877-382-4357. You can also file a complaint with your state attorney general’s consumer protection division. </p><aside><a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/smishing-phone-scam_l_6554dd0be4b0998d699e5c0f\"><img src=\"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/654d3b1f220000bb1518ddf8.jpg?cache=iLeKOsGbcZ&amp;ops=210_120\" /></a><a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/facebook-marketplace-scam-how-to-spot_l_646cda9de4b0005c605c39f3\"><img src=\"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/6470cad122000031004146d8.jpeg?cache=IPr8wbUl1X&amp;ops=210_120\" /></a><a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/gift-card-scam_l_64062700e4b029d870179f72\"><img src=\"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/64076f092500001f00dc5a65.jpg?ops=210_120\" /></a></aside></section></section><p>Do you have info to share with HuffPost reporters? <a href=\"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/securedrop\">Here’s how.</a></p><a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com\"> Go to Homepage</a><h2>Popular in the Community</h2>\\n<h2>FROM OUR PARTNER</h2>\\n\\n\\n</div>'}], 'summary': 'Buyer beware.

You can also file a complaint with your state attorney general’s consumer protection division. </p><aside><a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/smishing-phone-scam_l_6554dd0be4b0998d699e5c0f\"><img src=\"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/654d3b1f220000bb1518ddf8.jpg?cache=iLeKOsGbcZ&amp;ops=210_120\" /></a><a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/facebook-marketplace-scam-how-to-spot_l_646cda9de4b0005c605c39f3\"><img src=\"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/6470cad122000031004146d8.jpeg?cache=IPr8wbUl1X&amp;ops=210_120\" /></a><a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/gift-card-scam_l_64062700e4b029d870179f72\"><img src=\"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/64076f092500001f00dc5a65.jpg?ops=210_120\" /></a></aside></section></section><p>Do you have info to share with HuffPost reporters? <a href=\"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/securedrop\">Here’s how.</a></p><a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com\"> Go to Homepage</a><h2>Popular in the Community</h2>\\n<h2>FROM OUR PARTNER</h2>\\n\\n\\n</div>'}\n","Skipping already indexed news of title: The 6 Biggest Holiday Scams That Get Millions Of People Every Year\n","--------------------------------------------------\n","{'title': 'The 1 Thing You Need To Do Before You Start Holiday Shopping This Year', 'title_detail': {'type': 'text/plain', 'language': None, 'base': 'https://morss.it/:clip/https://www.huffpost.com/section/money/feed', 'value': 'The 1 Thing You Need To Do Before You Start Holiday Shopping This Year'}, 'links': [{'rel': 'alternate', 'type': 'text/html', 'href': 'https://www.huffpost.com/entry/financial-boundaries-holidays_l_6539cd16e4b011a9cf7c644a'}, {'length': '0', 'type': 'image/jpeg', 'href': 'https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/65641e1d230000ea71ea6667.jpeg?ops=224_126', 'rel': 'enclosure'}], 'link': 'https://www.huffpost.com/entry/financial-boundaries-holidays_l_6539cd16e4b011a9cf7c644a', 'published': 'Tue, 28 Nov 2023 05:45:01 -0500', 'published_parsed': time.struct_time(tm_year=2023, tm_mon=11, tm_mday=28, tm_hour=10, tm_min=45, tm_sec=1, tm_wday=1, tm_yday=332, tm_isdst=0), 'id': 'https://www.huffpost.com/entry/financial-boundaries-holidays_l_6539cd16e4b011a9cf7c644a', 'guidislink': False, 'comments': 'https://www.huffpost.com/entry/financial-boundaries-holidays_l_6539cd16e4b011a9cf7c644a#comments', 'content': [{'type': 'text/html', 'language': None, 'base': 'https://morss.it/:clip/https://www.huffpost.com/section/money/feed', 'value': 'Experts break down the best ways to establish and maintain healthy limits during the busiest shopping season.<br /><br /><hr /><br /><br /><div class=\"entry__content-list-container js-cet-unit-buzz_body\"><section class=\"entry__content-list js-main-content-list\" id=\"entry-body\"><section class=\"entry__content-list js-entry-content js-cet-subunit\"><p>The holidays are an exciting time for parties, sweet treats, shiny decor and family gatherings.

Set a budget based on your income and expenses and stick to it.

Identify everyone to whom you plan to give a gift.</p><p>“Put the amount you are willing to spend next to each item and/or person before you start shopping, and please, please update it in with your actual spending as you go,” said Anne Lester, a retirement savings expert and author of the upcoming book <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Your-Best-Financial-Life-Future/dp/006332086X?tag=carolinebologna-20&amp;ascsubtag=6539cd16e4b011a9cf7c644a%2C-1%2C-1%2Cd%2C0%2C0%2Chp-fil-am%3D0%2C0%3A0%2C0%2C0%2C0\">“Your Best Financial Life.”</a></p><p>She emphasized how easy it is to spend beyond your means, particularly in this era of apps and browser extensions that effectively gamify the process of purchasing expensive items and experiences.</p><div>Advertisement</div><p>“It’s important to set realistic and effective boundaries that will make you consider if the thing you are about to get for yourself or someone on your list is really something that is needed ― or even truly wanted,” Lester said. “A list is a great way to keep yourself accountable in real time.”</p><h2><strong>Get creative.</strong></h2><p>“Try achieving your gift giving goals by thinking outside of the box,” said Patrick Yono, founder of <a href=\"https://surelife-financial.com/\">Sure Life Financial</a>. “Your family members or friends might be just as happy with a $25 gift as they would with a $50 gift, so be creative with your budget in mind.”</p><p>Look for lower-cost gifts that pack a punch, or think about other ways to supplement a less expensive item.</p><p>“With high rates of inflation, don’t feel shame if your holiday season might look different than years past,” Howard said. “There might be less gifts under the tree, but maybe they’re more meaningful this year ― like a coupon book for your significant other or spending time with your family on a service project. We should all extend a little more grace this holiday season when it comes to spending.”</p><h2><strong>Start new traditions.</strong></h2><p>“If you’re vocal about the way spending depletes your funds and throws you off from reaching your financial goals, you’ll get support in your family,” Stevens noted. “Be brave and encourage your family members to create non-spending traditions like no-spend Christmases, or make regifting OK.

Or are you replacing quality time with physical items to make up for a busy work schedule?”</p><p>Once you’ve identified the reasons behind your spending and whether they align with the beliefs and values you want to be part of your life, you can create a mindful “values-based” holiday spending plan.</p><p>“With my own family, we discovered our values were giving back and spending time with nature,” Howard said. “For Christmas, we’ll celebrate by purchasing gifts for a family in need and taking a family vacation to a beach. Additionally, each of my kids will receive up to three gifts and one of the gifts will be something that can be used on vacation.”</p><div>Advertisement</div><h2><strong>Avoid emotional spending.</strong></h2><p>“When it comes to setting financial boundaries this holiday season, be hyper-aware of emotional triggers, social pressure, [fear of missing out] and today’s gift-giving culture,” Howard said. “If you are overspending, explore where you learned this behavior and dig for the root issue behind the spending.”</p><p>Emotional spending can be a big problem around the holiday season, which tends to bring up childhood memories and a sense of pressure to achieve Hallmark-style “perfection.”</p><p>“If you feel a rush from shopping, understand your purpose of spending,” Howard said. “Protecting yourself from yourself might look like knowing exactly what gifts you’re buying for others, or only shopping online to reduce extra purchases in store.”</p><h2><strong>Prepare to save after the holidays.</strong></h2><p>If you want to spend a little more around the holidays, try to compensate by saving more in the aftermath.</p><p>“A good method of handling the added expense of the holidays is to save it forward,” Yono said. “The winter season is a great time to save money by going out less and spending less.

Woroch noted that sales create a sense of urgency with buzzy terms like “one day only,” “limited time, “daily deal” and “flash sale” ― making customers feel like they’ll waste a rare opportunity if they don’t pounce.</p><p>“The reality is, retailers are constantly rolling out new sales, so just because you miss out on a sale today doesn’t mean you can’t get the same item on sale later,” she explained.</p><p>Many people also feel a sort of high when they score a good deal on an item, regardless of how much they wanted or needed it in the first place. But that high is temporary. </p><p>“Even if you get something at a really good sale price, you’re still spending money that could be going towards something more important, like building your savings, paying down debt, investing, etc.,” Woroch said. “A few bucks here and there adds up and can put a huge dent in your overall budget.”</p><p>Then there’s the fact that sale items often come with limited or nonexistent return policies.</p><p>“Once the momentary high of scoring the deal passes and you decide it was a bad purchase, you may be stuck with something you don’t need and don’t like,” Woroch said.</p><div>Advertisement</div><p>For some people, spaving leads to credit card debt, which can mean paying interest that far exceeds whatever was saved in the sales deal.</p><p>Below, Howard and Woroch share their advice for those who want to avoid falling into the trap of spaving, especially around the holidays. </p><h2><strong>Avoid sale alerts.</strong></h2><p>Remove the temptation to spave by avoiding sale alerts however possible. </p><p>“Unsubscribe from retail newsletters that send you the latest sales and deals from your favorite brands,” Woroch advised. “Turn off push [notifications] ... in store or deal apps ― or delete them altogether.”</p><h2><strong>Stick to your shopping list.</strong></h2><p>“Create a list before you go shopping and stick to it,” Howard suggested. “If you come across a sale either online or in-store, ask yourself if the item is on your shopping list.”</p><p>If you prefer to buy things at a discount, you can apply this advice to your everyday life, even if you aren’t on a shopping outing.

They’re known for being a politically engaged and digitally savvy generation who launched their adult careers during a pandemic and an economic crisis.</p><p>“They’re used to having information real-time on the tip of their fingers, and kind of managing their own schedule and having the type of autonomy and independence that older generations didn’t have,” said Jenny Fernandez, a leadership coach and startup mentor for the entrepreneur accelerator program Techstars. “So all of these [factors] contribute to their desire to be a little bit more self-driven and self-directed.”</p><div>Advertisement</div><p>In a recent <a href=\"https://www.robert-walters.ca/insights/news/blog/generation-driven-or-disengaged-gen-z.html\">survey</a> of over 1,200 U.S. professionals by global recruitment firm Robert Walters, under 1 in 5 Gen Z workers said that they preferred working in a team environment and 31% said that instead they “work better alone.”</p><blockquote><p>“If I can do it by myself, I will 99% of the time just prefer to do things by myself.”</p><div>- Andrea Lopez, a tech professional</div></blockquote><p>Andrea Lopez, a 26-year-old account manager at a big tech company, said the findings resonate with her experience. “I view collaborative projects as time-consuming,” she told HuffPost.</p><p>“When I know that I have to collaborate with people in order to carry out a certain project, that’s when I’m really happy to work collaboratively ... because that’s going to help get the job done,” she said. “But other than that, if I can do it by myself, I will 99% of the time just prefer to do things by myself.”</p><div>Advertisement</div><p>For Lopez, working alone helps her efficiently gather insights and data before she has to be in a team setting, and allows her to finish work on time. </p><p>She is aware that over-communication can be necessary, but said that it “feels like a drag. I honestly prefer to preserve my energy and over-communicate when it’s drastically needed.”</p><h2><strong>Why Gen Z Prefers More Solo Work</strong></h2><p>At work, Gen Zers’ independence can sometimes create the negative reputation that they are disengaged from the rest of their team. Managers in the Robert Walters report said that issues like a lack of communication skills (53%), teamwork (21%) and critical thinking (17%) were the primary barriers to younger workers being better collaborators.</p><p>When asked, Gen Z workers said that there is more nuance in why they might want to work alone than these generalized findings suggest.</p><p>Tony Guevara, a 23-year-old who runs Latino engagement for nonprofit Gen-Z for Change, said his preferred working style is situation-dependent. He likes working alone when he does not need help and can listen to his music uninterrupted, because that allows him to be productive. But at the same time, he appreciates when there are colleagues around, too.</p><div>Advertisement</div><p>“I’m going to ask for help, because I’m not going to make it harder on myself,” he told HuffPost.</p><p>He said Gen Zers might prefer doing things solo because they work in a judgmental environment. They might be in a workplace where they cannot listen to music uninterrupted, or where eating a snack during a meeting could cause colleagues to think, “Oh, is this really the time to be eating?”</p><p>With other colleagues present, “you kind of have that magnifying glass on you,” he said.</p><p>Lopez said that managers can also misconstrue Gen Z colleagues not showing up to the office as a lack of team spirit. “I just want to clarify, ‘No, I am literally just preserving my energy,’” she said. “And I want to come in when I know that I can bring my best self to work.”</p><p>For example, she used a month and a half in which she did not have to be at the office to save up energy for a week when her program managers were in town and she could do the face time necessary to build relationships.</p><p>“I think workplaces just need to start adjusting to work preference diversity, and allow employees to show up in the way that they feel like they’re going to be able to best present themselves,” Lopez said. </p><h2><strong>What Gen Z And Older Generations Can Learn From Each Other</strong></h2><p>Fernandez said that there should be flexibility for remote work and working alone, but said it can also be helpful for Gen Z professionals to know that “you cannot be efficient with people. As logical as we are, we are emotional beings.”</p><div>Advertisement</div><p>Even though it can be inefficient, physically showing up at work can increase relationship-building, and it’s “where you learn to manage dysfunctional teammates, where you learn to negotiate or, frankly, even influence others about your idea,” she said.</p><p>Guevara said that when he advises Gen Z friends who work remotely and alone, he asks them to separate the situations where it’s comfortable to work alone versus where it’s necessary.</p><p>“If you need music to work, that’s one thing,” he said. “But if you just prefer to be in a quiet space, that’s also something that you can do with other people, like within reach to ask for help.”</p><p>It shouldn’t be all on Gen Z co-workers to bridge the generational divide, though. In a 2022 Gallup <a href=\"https://www.gallup.com/workplace/404693/generation-disconnected-data-gen-workplace.aspx\">poll</a>, Gen Z was the demographic most ambivalent and disengaged with the workplace, but it was not because young workers were slacking off and not caring about their jobs. Most reported missing a close connection to their colleagues, manager or employer.</p><p>Fernandez said that because a lot of Gen Z workers started their first jobs during the COVID-19 pandemic, “they did not have as much of the social routine interactions that older generations had when they graduated.” </p><div>Advertisement</div><p>That’s something managers can change. Fernandez said that “reverse mentoring” — by pairing a younger colleague with an older one — can be a way for the two to learn from each other.</p><blockquote><p>“Try talking to them like they’re a co-worker, and not a co-worker who’s Gen Z.”</p><div>- Tony Guevara, a professional with Gen-Z for Change</div></blockquote><p>And managers should directly solicit feedback from their Gen Z colleagues, and be open to changing their workflow. When Fernandez teaches university students, she said that she asks for class volunteers to be her internal focus group, so they can tell her what’s working and what’s not in the classroom.</p><p>“[Gen Z is] going to be the next set of managers,” Fernandez said. “So we need to ensure that they’re successful.”</p><p>Guevara said that it can also help for older managers to avoid talking down to Gen Z colleagues.</p><p>“Try talking to them like they’re a co-worker, and not a co-worker who’s Gen Z,” he said. “There’s that preconceived notion that ‘Gen Z is lazy, Gen Z doesn’t like working with other people’ that they’ll use to influence how they approach a situation with someone who happens to be Gen Z.”</p><div>Advertisement</div><p>Guevara said that he has Gen Z friends who “get talked down to” by others at work, “as if they don’t know what they’re talking about.”</p><p>“The way that they talk to people is obviously going to have an impact, especially when there’s a huge age difference,” he said. </p><h4>Support HuffPost</h4><h4>A No-B.S.

But there\\'s a simple fix.<br /><br /><hr /><br /><br /><div class=\"entry__content-list-container js-cet-unit-buzz_body\"><section class=\"entry__content-list js-main-content-list\" id=\"entry-body\"><section class=\"entry__content-list js-entry-content js-cet-subunit\"><p>Every generation has its own reputation ― and that shapes how its cohort is seen at work.</p><p>Take Gen Z, the people born around 1995 to 2010. They’re known for being a politically engaged and digitally savvy generation who launched their adult careers during a pandemic and an economic crisis.</p><p>“They’re used to having information real-time on the tip of their fingers, and kind of managing their own schedule and having the type of autonomy and independence that older generations didn’t have,” said Jenny Fernandez, a leadership coach and startup mentor for the entrepreneur accelerator program Techstars. “So all of these [factors] contribute to their desire to be a little bit more self-driven and self-directed.”</p><div>Advertisement</div><p>In a recent <a href=\"https://www.robert-walters.ca/insights/news/blog/generation-driven-or-disengaged-gen-z.html\">survey</a> of over 1,200 U.S. professionals by global recruitment firm Robert Walters, under 1 in 5 Gen Z workers said that they preferred working in a team environment and 31% said that instead they “work better alone.”</p><blockquote><p>“If I can do it by myself, I will 99% of the time just prefer to do things by myself.”</p><div>- Andrea Lopez, a tech professional</div></blockquote><p>Andrea Lopez, a 26-year-old account manager at a big tech company, said the findings resonate with her experience. “I view collaborative projects as time-consuming,” she told HuffPost.</p><p>“When I know that I have to collaborate with people in order to carry out a certain project, that’s when I’m really happy to work collaboratively ... because that’s going to help get the job done,” she said. “But other than that, if I can do it by myself, I will 99% of the time just prefer to do things by myself.”</p><div>Advertisement</div><p>For Lopez, working alone helps her efficiently gather insights and data before she has to be in a team setting, and allows her to finish work on time. </p><p>She is aware that over-communication can be necessary, but said that it “feels like a drag. I honestly prefer to preserve my energy and over-communicate when it’s drastically needed.”</p><h2><strong>Why Gen Z Prefers More Solo Work</strong></h2><p>At work, Gen Zers’ independence can sometimes create the negative reputation that they are disengaged from the rest of their team. Managers in the Robert Walters report said that issues like a lack of communication skills (53%), teamwork (21%) and critical thinking (17%) were the primary barriers to younger workers being better collaborators.</p><p>When asked, Gen Z workers said that there is more nuance in why they might want to work alone than these generalized findings suggest.</p><p>Tony Guevara, a 23-year-old who runs Latino engagement for nonprofit Gen-Z for Change, said his preferred working style is situation-dependent. He likes working alone when he does not need help and can listen to his music uninterrupted, because that allows him to be productive. But at the same time, he appreciates when there are colleagues around, too.</p><div>Advertisement</div><p>“I’m going to ask for help, because I’m not going to make it harder on myself,” he told HuffPost.</p><p>He said Gen Zers might prefer doing things solo because they work in a judgmental environment. They might be in a workplace where they cannot listen to music uninterrupted, or where eating a snack during a meeting could cause colleagues to think, “Oh, is this really the time to be eating?”</p><p>With other colleagues present, “you kind of have that magnifying glass on you,” he said.</p><p>Lopez said that managers can also misconstrue Gen Z colleagues not showing up to the office as a lack of team spirit. “I just want to clarify, ‘No, I am literally just preserving my energy,’” she said. “And I want to come in when I know that I can bring my best self to work.”</p><p>For example, she used a month and a half in which she did not have to be at the office to save up energy for a week when her program managers were in town and she could do the face time necessary to build relationships.</p><p>“I think workplaces just need to start adjusting to work preference diversity, and allow employees to show up in the way that they feel like they’re going to be able to best present themselves,” Lopez said. </p><h2><strong>What Gen Z And Older Generations Can Learn From Each Other</strong></h2><p>Fernandez said that there should be flexibility for remote work and working alone, but said it can also be helpful for Gen Z professionals to know that “you cannot be efficient with people. As logical as we are, we are emotional beings.”</p><div>Advertisement</div><p>Even though it can be inefficient, physically showing up at work can increase relationship-building, and it’s “where you learn to manage dysfunctional teammates, where you learn to negotiate or, frankly, even influence others about your idea,” she said.</p><p>Guevara said that when he advises Gen Z friends who work remotely and alone, he asks them to separate the situations where it’s comfortable to work alone versus where it’s necessary.</p><p>“If you need music to work, that’s one thing,” he said. “But if you just prefer to be in a quiet space, that’s also something that you can do with other people, like within reach to ask for help.”</p><p>It shouldn’t be all on Gen Z co-workers to bridge the generational divide, though.

And every year, there’s new language to articulate those long-held but often buried feelings.</p><p>We rounded up some of these viral and compelling terms, all of which capture the complexities of our careers. Here are the work words that defined 2023:</p><div>Advertisement</div><h2><strong>1. The Lazy Girl Job</strong></h2><p>This year marked a turning point for how younger professionals are setting their work expectations. This is not the <a href=\"https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2020/06/9867469/working-in-toxic-media-industry-diversity-movement\">“grateful to be here” generation</a> that will put up with toxic bosses, long hours and low salaries in order to pay dues. Instead, there was the rise of “lazy girl jobs.”</p><p>In a May <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@gabrielle_judge/video/7236129804066524459\">TikTok video</a>, Gabrielle Judge ― a content creator who popularized the term ― defined “lazy girl jobs” as positions where you can have “pretty comfortable salaries, and not do that much work and be remote.”</p><blockquote>  <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@gabrielle_judge?refer=embed\" title=\"@gabrielle_judge\">@gabrielle_judge</a> <p>Career advice for women who don’t know what remote job to apply to.

They want stricter boundaries between the demands of their job and their personal lives. They’re not impressed by Bagel Fridays at the office. They would much prefer to clock out early and return to their real lives with their friends and families.</p><h2><strong>2. Bare Minimum Mondays </strong></h2><p>“Bare minimum Mondays” have given people a way to think about how to start their week doing less.</p><p>Marisa Jo Mayes, a content creator who popularized the term in a TikTok this year, told her followers that her practice of “bare minimum Mondays” stemmed from how she lived in her 20s. In her video, Mayes recalled staying up late on Sundays dreading the workweek and creating long to-do lists that she would not complete the following day.</p><p>One day, she gave herself “permission to do the absolute bare minimum for work that day, and everything felt different. The pressure was gone,” Mayes <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@itsmarisajo/video/7191918358676344110\">said</a> in her TikTok. She’s been “reaping the benefits of this practice ever since that day.”</p><p>The idea struck a chord with viewers. The hashtag <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/bareminimummonday\">#bareminimummonday</a> has accrued more than 2 million views, a sign of how more of us just want permission to ease ourselves into the stressful workweek.</p><div>Advertisement</div><h2><strong>3. Voluntelling</strong></h2><p>If you’ve been quote-unquote “volunteered” for an assignment you didn’t ask for, you’ve actually been “voluntold.” It’s a phrase that was <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/phrases-only-people-in-the-military-know-2014-10\">popularized</a> by the U.S. military to describe situations where somebody is volunteered for a task without getting the opportunity to say “no,” and with implicit pressure to say “yes.”</p><p>At work, these assignments may not sound exactly like marching orders, but deep down, you know they are. If you want to push back, you can point out how the addition of a new assignment could negatively affect your other duties. </p><p>If you’re a manager who does this, give employees the chance to weigh in on whether this “exciting new opportunity” is actually useful to them. After you say “Hey, I thought of you for this,” add language like “Let me know if this is of value to you,” as Gregory Tall, a workshop facilitator who coaches managers, <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/voluntell-meaning-bad-boss_l_641896f0e4b01ea5cd8f8204\">previously told HuffPost</a>.</p><h2><strong>4. ‘Hey’ Hanging </strong></h2><p>On instant messenger platforms like Slack, simple greetings can take on magnified importance without the reassuring context of tone and body language.</p><p>That’s why it’s easy for a brief “Hey” on Slack to send us into a worried spiral. Without a follow-up, you may think the sender is upset, or that you’re about to get roped into a project you don’t want to do.</p><div>Advertisement</div><p>A term like “‘hey’ hanging” perfectly describes the anxiety co-workers may be causing with their messages.</p><p>“All communication at work via email or Slack should have a clear agenda and purpose,” Pattie Ehsaei, a senior vice president of mergers and acquisitions lending at a major bank, previously <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/hey-hanging-work-chat_l_64c9387ae4b0fd06594dd491\">told</a> HuffPost about why “hey” hanging is a bad idea at the office. “‘Hey’ leaves the receiver confused as to the purpose of the communication and doesn’t initiate a reply.”</p><p>Less isn’t always more when it comes to online chats. When in doubt, over-communicate your intentions about why you are reaching out, and avoid confusing your colleagues in your initial message.</p><h2><strong>5. Quiet Cutting</strong></h2><p>In 2022, “<a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/you-could-be-quiet-quitting-your-job-and-not-even-know-it-goog_l_656504cee4b05f498ba17f83\">quiet quitting</a>” became a popular catchphrase to describe employees doing the bare minimum at their jobs as they search for better ones. But this summer, employers got their revenge with the rise of “quiet cutting.”</p><p>Quiet cutting is what happens when you get a “reassignment of duties” and you lose the role or job title you were hired for, though you remain employed.</p><div>Advertisement</div><p>This summer, more tech employees <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/lifestyle/careers/youve-heard-of-quiet-quitting-now-companies-are-quiet-cutting-ba2c326d\">complained</a> that they received these “reassignment” orders from employers. Although it can sometimes be a new opportunity to learn a new skill, it can also be an ominous sign of your future at the company.</p><p>Peter Rahbar, an employment attorney who has worked with clients getting these reassignments, previously <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/quiet-cutting-job_l_64ef70c9e4b002c03645ec30\">told</a> HuffPost that a reassignment is a sign of your expendability.</p><p>“I don’t see it as ever being a good thing for an employee,” Rahbar warned. “If it were to happen to me, the first thing I would do is probably start my job search immediately for something that did suit my skills where I would be a better fit.”</p><h2><strong>6. Body Doubling</strong></h2><p>If you work best with an accountability buddy, try a work exercise known as “<a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/body-doubling-adhd-tasks_l_63da7fbce4b01a4363919cad\">body doubling</a>.”</p><p>With this technique, commonly used by professionals with ADHD, you do a task and have another person on Zoom or in person doing a task too. This way, the person with ADHD can stay anchored to the present and focused.</p><p>You might already be doing body doubling without knowing it has a name. It can mean working quietly with a friend in a coffee shop, or it can mean having them finish the same task as you at the same time. Either way, try out this hack if you have trouble concentrating or finishing tasks. </p><div>Advertisement</div><h2><strong>7. </strong><strong>Post-Work Restraint Collapse</strong></h2><p>If you’ve ever felt like screaming into a pillow or lying on your couch after a hard day at work, you might be feeling something known as “<a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/post-work-restraint-collapse-signs_l_652ffdefe4b0da897ab64811\">post-work restraint collapse</a>.”</p><p>It’s a concept that therapists are using to describe the bone-deep exhaustion caused by draining work days. The “collapse” that happens after work is what happens when you finally feel safe to release pent-up emotions.</p><p>Post-work restraint collapse can look like “a sense of depletion and having nothing left for other activities, even things that you might really enjoy, like exercise, spending time with your family or other social activities,” <a href=\"https://www.choosingtherapy.com/emily-treichler-phd-lcp/\">Emily Treichler</a>, a licensed clinical psychologist, previously told HuffPost about post-work restraint collapse.</p><p>This weariness can affect your moods, and your lowered patience and increased irritability can strain relationships with loved ones, which is why it’s important to address.</p><p>Focus on what you can control first. Channel those after-work emotions through journaling, meditating or movement, therapists <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/post-work-restraint-collapse-signs_l_652ffdefe4b0da897ab64811\">recommend</a>.

And every year, there’s new language to articulate those long-held but often buried feelings.</p><p>We rounded up some of these viral and compelling terms, all of which capture the complexities of our careers. Here are the work words that defined 2023:</p><div>Advertisement</div><h2><strong>1. The Lazy Girl Job</strong></h2><p>This year marked a turning point for how younger professionals are setting their work expectations. This is not the <a href=\"https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2020/06/9867469/working-in-toxic-media-industry-diversity-movement\">“grateful to be here” generation</a> that will put up with toxic bosses, long hours and low salaries in order to pay dues. Instead, there was the rise of “lazy girl jobs.”</p><p>In a May <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@gabrielle_judge/video/7236129804066524459\">TikTok video</a>, Gabrielle Judge ― a content creator who popularized the term ― defined “lazy girl jobs” as positions where you can have “pretty comfortable salaries, and not do that much work and be remote.”</p><blockquote>  <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@gabrielle_judge?refer=embed\" title=\"@gabrielle_judge\">@gabrielle_judge</a> <p>Career advice for women who don’t know what remote job to apply to. You can bay your bills at not feel tired at the end of the day. Women are here to collect those pay checks and move on from the work day. We have so much more fun stuff happeneing in our 5-9 that is way more important than a boss that you hate.    <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/corporatejobs?refer=embed\" title=\"corporatejobs\">#corporatejobs</a> <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/jobsearchhacks?refer=embed\" title=\"jobsearchhacks\">#jobsearchhacks</a> <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/remoteworking?refer=embed\" title=\"remoteworking\">#remoteworking</a> <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/antihustleculture?refer=embed\" title=\"antihustleculture\">#antihustleculture</a> <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/9to5?refer=embed\" title=\"9to5\">#9to5</a> </p> <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/music/original-sound-7236129823133928234?refer=embed\" title=\"♬ original sound - Anti Work Girlboss\">♬ original sound - Anti Work Girlboss</a>  </blockquote> <p>As Judge previously <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/lazy-girl-jobs-tiktok_l_64e38814e4b09133924c4ad1\">told</a> HuffPost: “A ‘lazy girl job’ mindset is all about creating as much freedom and space in your personal life as possible through efficient work days, although not everyone will understand.”</p><div>Advertisement</div><p>The LGJ’s wide appeal on TikTok speaks to how professionals are redefining success. They want stricter boundaries between the demands of their job and their personal lives. They’re not impressed by Bagel Fridays at the office. They would much prefer to clock out early and return to their real lives with their friends and families.</p><h2><strong>2. Bare Minimum Mondays </strong></h2><p>“Bare minimum Mondays” have given people a way to think about how to start their week doing less.</p><p>Marisa Jo Mayes, a content creator who popularized the term in a TikTok this year, told her followers that her practice of “bare minimum Mondays” stemmed from how she lived in her 20s. In her video, Mayes recalled staying up late on Sundays dreading the workweek and creating long to-do lists that she would not complete the following day.</p><p>One day, she gave herself “permission to do the absolute bare minimum for work that day, and everything felt different. The pressure was gone,” Mayes <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@itsmarisajo/video/7191918358676344110\">said</a> in her TikTok. She’s been “reaping the benefits of this practice ever since that day.”</p><p>The idea struck a chord with viewers. The hashtag <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/bareminimummonday\">#bareminimummonday</a> has accrued more than 2 million views, a sign of how more of us just want permission to ease ourselves into the stressful workweek.</p><div>Advertisement</div><h2><strong>3. Voluntelling</strong></h2><p>If you’ve been quote-unquote “volunteered” for an assignment you didn’t ask for, you’ve actually been “voluntold.” It’s a phrase that was <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/phrases-only-people-in-the-military-know-2014-10\">popularized</a> by the U.S. military to describe situations where somebody is volunteered for a task without getting the opportunity to say “no,” and with implicit pressure to say “yes.”</p><p>At work, these assignments may not sound exactly like marching orders, but deep down, you know they are. If you want to push back, you can point out how the addition of a new assignment could negatively affect your other duties. </p><p>If you’re a manager who does this, give employees the chance to weigh in on whether this “exciting new opportunity” is actually useful to them. After you say “Hey, I thought of you for this,” add language like “Let me know if this is of value to you,” as Gregory Tall, a workshop facilitator who coaches managers, <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/voluntell-meaning-bad-boss_l_641896f0e4b01ea5cd8f8204\">previously told HuffPost</a>.</p><h2><strong>4. ‘Hey’ Hanging </strong></h2><p>On instant messenger platforms like Slack, simple greetings can take on magnified importance without the reassuring context of tone and body language.</p><p>That’s why it’s easy for a brief “Hey” on Slack to send us into a worried spiral. Without a follow-up, you may think the sender is upset, or that you’re about to get roped into a project you don’t want to do.</p><div>Advertisement</div><p>A term like “‘hey’ hanging” perfectly describes the anxiety co-workers may be causing with their messages.</p><p>“All communication at work via email or Slack should have a clear agenda and purpose,” Pattie Ehsaei, a senior vice president of mergers and acquisitions lending at a major bank, previously <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/hey-hanging-work-chat_l_64c9387ae4b0fd06594dd491\">told</a> HuffPost about why “hey” hanging is a bad idea at the office. “‘Hey’ leaves the receiver confused as to the purpose of the communication and doesn’t initiate a reply.”</p><p>Less isn’t always more when it comes to online chats. When in doubt, over-communicate your intentions about why you are reaching out, and avoid confusing your colleagues in your initial message.</p><h2><strong>5. Quiet Cutting</strong></h2><p>In 2022, “<a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/you-could-be-quiet-quitting-your-job-and-not-even-know-it-goog_l_656504cee4b05f498ba17f83\">quiet quitting</a>” became a popular catchphrase to describe employees doing the bare minimum at their jobs as they search for better ones. But this summer, employers got their revenge with the rise of “quiet cutting.”</p><p>Quiet cutting is what happens when you get a “reassignment of duties” and you lose the role or job title you were hired for, though you remain employed.</p><div>Advertisement</div><p>This summer, more tech employees <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/lifestyle/careers/youve-heard-of-quiet-quitting-now-companies-are-quiet-cutting-ba2c326d\">complained</a> that they received these “reassignment” orders from employers. Although it can sometimes be a new opportunity to learn a new skill, it can also be an ominous sign of your future at the company.</p><p>Peter Rahbar, an employment attorney who has worked with clients getting these reassignments, previously <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/quiet-cutting-job_l_64ef70c9e4b002c03645ec30\">told</a> HuffPost that a reassignment is a sign of your expendability.</p><p>“I don’t see it as ever being a good thing for an employee,” Rahbar warned. “If it were to happen to me, the first thing I would do is probably start my job search immediately for something that did suit my skills where I would be a better fit.”</p><h2><strong>6. Body Doubling</strong></h2><p>If you work best with an accountability buddy, try a work exercise known as “<a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/body-doubling-adhd-tasks_l_63da7fbce4b01a4363919cad\">body doubling</a>.”</p><p>With this technique, commonly used by professionals with ADHD, you do a task and have another person on Zoom or in person doing a task too. This way, the person with ADHD can stay anchored to the present and focused.</p><p>You might already be doing body doubling without knowing it has a name. It can mean working quietly with a friend in a coffee shop, or it can mean having them finish the same task as you at the same time. Either way, try out this hack if you have trouble concentrating or finishing tasks. </p><div>Advertisement</div><h2><strong>7. </strong><strong>Post-Work Restraint Collapse</strong></h2><p>If you’ve ever felt like screaming into a pillow or lying on your couch after a hard day at work, you might be feeling something known as “<a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/post-work-restraint-collapse-signs_l_652ffdefe4b0da897ab64811\">post-work restraint collapse</a>.”</p><p>It’s a concept that therapists are using to describe the bone-deep exhaustion caused by draining work days. The “collapse” that happens after work is what happens when you finally feel safe to release pent-up emotions.</p><p>Post-work restraint collapse can look like “a sense of depletion and having nothing left for other activities, even things that you might really enjoy, like exercise, spending time with your family or other social activities,” <a href=\"https://www.choosingtherapy.com/emily-treichler-phd-lcp/\">Emily Treichler</a>, a licensed clinical psychologist, previously told HuffPost about post-work restraint collapse.</p><p>This weariness can affect your moods, and your lowered patience and increased irritability can strain relationships with loved ones, which is why it’s important to address.</p><p>Focus on what you can control first. Channel those after-work emotions through journaling, meditating or movement, therapists <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/post-work-restraint-collapse-signs_l_652ffdefe4b0da897ab64811\">recommend</a>. And if you’re seeing a pattern where talking with your boss doesn’t help your symptoms, it might be time to address the underlying problem of your job.</p><div>Advertisement</div><p>See if changing teams or bosses can help relieve symptoms. If not, start planning your exit. No job is worth ruining your mental health over.</p><h4>Support HuffPost</h4><h4>A No-B.S.

Just three weeks ago, the Transportation Security Administration screened the <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/tsa-record-travelers-passengers-thanksgiving_l_6564e8a8e4b0827ae6157cfd\">highest-ever number of people</a> to go through security on a single day, with 2,907,378 individuals passing through airport checkpoints on the Sunday after Thanksgiving. </p><p>The week leading up to Christmas promises to bring large numbers of travelers as well ― and with them, a large amount of stress. </p><div>Advertisement</div><p>“Traveling can be stressful, especially when it comes to air travel,” Katy Nastro, spokesperson for the flight alert service, Going, told HuffPost. “You’re very much out of control for the majority of the experience, and for many of us, the feeling of being in control keeps stress levels at bay. On top of all of that, you add the holidays, which pose their own unique stresses and expectations.”</p><p>In addition to crowds at the airport and full flights, there’s a potential for chaos with delays and cancellations (as we saw with <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/southwest-cancels-more-flights-draws-federal-investigation_n_63ac32a3e4b0cbfd55dec676\">Southwest Airlines last Christmas</a>).</p><p>“Let’s not forget Mother Nature can wreak havoc in the form of flight disruptions due to winter storms,” Nastro added.</p><p>The holiday season brings a lot of strong emotions as well.</p><p>“People put such high importance on the holidays being perfect ― getting home to see friends and family, having the perfect gifts, and you’ve put so much effort in, probably a lot of money too ― that when things go wrong, you feel them 10 times more than you probably would at any other time of year,” said <a href=\"https://tours.solofemaletravelers.club/\">Meg Jerrard</a> from Solo Female Travelers Tours.</p><div>Advertisement</div><p>“And when you’re already stressed, you tend to be paying less attention to the things you should be paying attention to, which means things go wrong more easily ― missing a turn on the highway and missing your flight, forgetting to pack important things because you’re frantic in the lead-up to leaving,” she added. </p><p>Fortunately, there are some steps you can take in advance of and during the transit process to feel less on edge while traveling around this time. HuffPost asked Nastro, Jerrard and other travel experts to share their advice for making holiday travel less stressful. </p><h2><strong>Be strategic about when you fly.</strong></h2><p>“If you have not booked yet, opt for nonstop flights very early in the morning,” advised <a href=\"https://thevacationer.com/\">Phil Dengler</a>, co-founder of The Vacationer. “Cancellations and delays snowball throughout the day, so early-morning flights tend to experience fewer interruptions than those later in the day.”</p><p>Try to fly on days that are historically less busy as well. Dengler suggested Dec. 18, 19, 20, 28 and 29, as well as Christmas Eve and Christmas Day, as those tend to offer better prices and less chaos.</p><p>“Book your flights and accommodations well in advance to secure the best deals and availability,” added <a href=\"https://www.milkandhoneytravels.com/about\">Brianna Glenn</a>, CEO and travel adviser at Milk + Honey Travels. “Also, check the weather forecast and be prepared for any travel disruptions.”</p><div>Advertisement</div><p>In the event of disruptive weather, know your rights and options.</p><p>“Thanksgiving travel went smoothly, but Christmas and New Year’s have greater potential for snow storms,” Dengler said. “Check if your airline offers a weather waiver, which lets you change your flight at no additional cost if the forecast is looking bad.”</p><h2><strong>Pack smart.</strong></h2><p>“Make a checklist and pack efficiently to avoid overpacking,” Glenn recommended. “Don’t forget essentials like chargers, travel documents and medications in your carry-on if you are checking luggage, and also include an <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/apple-air-tags-cyber-monday_l_6564c7ede4b0f35896f6d881\">AirTag in each piece of checked luggage</a>.”</p><p>Try to fit <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/how-to-travel-with-just-a-carry-on-goog_l_652d7e32e4b00565b6210f78\">everything into a carry-on luggage</a> to minimize the risk of losing your belongings in transit. </p><p>“Do not check a bag unless you have to,” Dengler said. “Lines are usually long during the holidays to drop bags off, and airlines have been known to lose or misplace luggage more often during busy times. Many non-basic economy tickets allow you to bring a carry-on and a personal item, so check your ticket’s baggage allowance.”</p><p>And if traveling with a checked bag is essential, try to book a nonstop flight. </p><p>“Transferring a bag from flight to flight is one of the primary reasons bags can be lost,” Nastro said. “You can decrease these odds by flying straight to your source when possible!”</p><div>Advertisement</div><h2><strong>Arrive early.</strong></h2><p>“Allow extra time for check-ins and security screenings to account for potential delays,” advised <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/travelwithmeko/\">Jessica-Kameko Rooks</a>, blogger at Travel With Meko. “Holiday travel, particularly when it involves air travel, can become notably stressful for several reasons.”</p><p>She pointed to the increase in the number of people traveling around the holiday season, which means crowded airports, long lines and packed flights. </p><p>“Additionally, heightened security measures during peak travel times can contribute to longer wait times and thorough screenings, making the overall experience more time-consuming and potentially frustrating,” Rooks added.</p><p>Give yourself enough buffer time to deal with the lengthy lines for security checkpoints and bag check counters (if you must). Consider enrolling in expedited security options like <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/tsa-precheck-global-entry-clear-explained_l_62955c5ce4b0415d4d890655\">Clear or TSA PreCheck</a> as well.</p><h2><strong>Get organized.</strong></h2><p>Staying organized goes a long way in reducing travel stress. Before your journey, make sure you have everything you need in order. </p><div>Advertisement</div><p>“Keep important documents, like your passport and boarding passes, easily accessible,” Glenn advised. “Have a designated spot for your travel essentials to avoid scrambling at security checkpoints.”</p><p>Don’t forget to prepare some entertainment as well. Glenn recommended packing books, and downloading movies and podcasts to keep yourself occupied during the journey.</p><p>“It can help distract you from any travel stress,” she added. </p><figure><img src=\"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/65800b592200005300faf0f2.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale\" /><span>Betsie Van der Meer via Getty Images</span><figcaption>Don\\'t forget to pack some patience, perspective and positivity. </figcaption></figure><h2><strong>Maintain perspective and a positive attitude.</strong></h2><p>Don’t forget to pack your patience, perspective and positive attitude. It will help with stressful moments.</p><p>“So your flight is delayed and you’re stuck in an airport for 15 hours? Make it an adventure,” Jerrard said. “You can choose to see things as a terrible way to spend the holidays, or as that memory that you and your kids tell for 20 years to come at the Christmas table, that you went on a treasure hunt through an airport on Christmas Eve.”</p><div>Advertisement</div><p>Embody the holiday spirit and look for moments of magic ― or create them yourself. Do what you can do, enjoy the ride and be present. </p><p>“Holidays don’t need to be perfect to be memorable, or to achieve what you want them to be,” Jerrard said. “Focus on what’s important to you instead. Are you delayed with your family in the airport? Start spending time together there. Are you in the airport solo? Use the downtime as an opportunity to start video calling people you wouldn’t have otherwise had the time to call.” </p><h2><strong>Take care of yourself.</strong></h2><p>“Stay hydrated and rested,” Glenn urged. “Travel can be exhausting, so prioritize self-care.”</p><p>She emphasized the importance of drinking plenty of water, getting sleep and taking breaks when needed during the stressful holiday travel season. </p><h2><strong>Consider travel insurance.</strong></h2><p>“Consider travel insurance for added peace of mind in case of unexpected events,” Rooks said.</p><p>Holiday travel often comes with inclement weather and unplanned cancellations, so do your research to <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/travel-insurance-pandemic_l_6091fb92e4b02e74d22cf5f6\">see if travel insurance is worth it</a> for your trip.</p><p>“I highly recommend that travelers buy travel insurance and also develop alternative plans for travel,” echoed <a href=\"https://diningtraveler.com/\">Jessica van Dop DeJesus</a>, founder and editor at The Dining Traveler. “The reality is that travel volume is at a record high, so travelers have to be patient and cover their costs.”</p><div>Advertisement</div><p>If your travel includes expensive non-refundable bookings that aren’t covered by your credit card’s insurance policy, then separate travel insurance might be the move. Compare plans and choose the best one for you. </p><h2><strong>Think about a solo trip.</strong></h2><p>“Try traveling solo,” suggested <a href=\"https://www.flashpack.com/\">Radha Vyas</a>, co-founder and CEO of adventure travel company Flash Pack. “When you’re only responsible for yourself, you can focus on what you really want to get out of the trip and allow your mind to broaden to new experiences and connections.”</p><p>There are countless advantages to solo travel, including the ability to move at your preferred pace and prioritize what matters to you. As we transition from 2023 into 2024, you might also benefit from taking the time alone to reflect on your experiences this past year and set goals for the new year.</p><h2><strong>Avoid holiday travel if you can.</strong></h2><p>“If possible, do not fly at all,” Dengler said. “While you can do everything right, traveling around the holidays is still stressful. The greatest risk is severe weather that grounds flights for more than a few days.”</p><p>Staying home can offer a truly relaxing and cozy holiday experience.

Just three weeks ago, the Transportation Security Administration screened the <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/tsa-record-travelers-passengers-thanksgiving_l_6564e8a8e4b0827ae6157cfd\">highest-ever number of people</a> to go through security on a single day, with 2,907,378 individuals passing through airport checkpoints on the Sunday after Thanksgiving. </p><p>The week leading up to Christmas promises to bring large numbers of travelers as well ― and with them, a large amount of stress. </p><div>Advertisement</div><p>“Traveling can be stressful, especially when it comes to air travel,” Katy Nastro, spokesperson for the flight alert service, Going, told HuffPost. “You’re very much out of control for the majority of the experience, and for many of us, the feeling of being in control keeps stress levels at bay. On top of all of that, you add the holidays, which pose their own unique stresses and expectations.”</p><p>In addition to crowds at the airport and full flights, there’s a potential for chaos with delays and cancellations (as we saw with <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/southwest-cancels-more-flights-draws-federal-investigation_n_63ac32a3e4b0cbfd55dec676\">Southwest Airlines last Christmas</a>).</p><p>“Let’s not forget Mother Nature can wreak havoc in the form of flight disruptions due to winter storms,” Nastro added.</p><p>The holiday season brings a lot of strong emotions as well.</p><p>“People put such high importance on the holidays being perfect ― getting home to see friends and family, having the perfect gifts, and you’ve put so much effort in, probably a lot of money too ― that when things go wrong, you feel them 10 times more than you probably would at any other time of year,” said <a href=\"https://tours.solofemaletravelers.club/\">Meg Jerrard</a> from Solo Female Travelers Tours.</p><div>Advertisement</div><p>“And when you’re already stressed, you tend to be paying less attention to the things you should be paying attention to, which means things go wrong more easily ― missing a turn on the highway and missing your flight, forgetting to pack important things because you’re frantic in the lead-up to leaving,” she added. </p><p>Fortunately, there are some steps you can take in advance of and during the transit process to feel less on edge while traveling around this time. HuffPost asked Nastro, Jerrard and other travel experts to share their advice for making holiday travel less stressful. </p><h2><strong>Be strategic about when you fly.</strong></h2><p>“If you have not booked yet, opt for nonstop flights very early in the morning,” advised <a href=\"https://thevacationer.com/\">Phil Dengler</a>, co-founder of The Vacationer. “Cancellations and delays snowball throughout the day, so early-morning flights tend to experience fewer interruptions than those later in the day.”</p><p>Try to fly on days that are historically less busy as well. Dengler suggested Dec. 18, 19, 20, 28 and 29, as well as Christmas Eve and Christmas Day, as those tend to offer better prices and less chaos.</p><p>“Book your flights and accommodations well in advance to secure the best deals and availability,” added <a href=\"https://www.milkandhoneytravels.com/about\">Brianna Glenn</a>, CEO and travel adviser at Milk + Honey Travels. “Also, check the weather forecast and be prepared for any travel disruptions.”</p><div>Advertisement</div><p>In the event of disruptive weather, know your rights and options.</p><p>“Thanksgiving travel went smoothly, but Christmas and New Year’s have greater potential for snow storms,” Dengler said. “Check if your airline offers a weather waiver, which lets you change your flight at no additional cost if the forecast is looking bad.”</p><h2><strong>Pack smart.</strong></h2><p>“Make a checklist and pack efficiently to avoid overpacking,” Glenn recommended. “Don’t forget essentials like chargers, travel documents and medications in your carry-on if you are checking luggage, and also include an <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/apple-air-tags-cyber-monday_l_6564c7ede4b0f35896f6d881\">AirTag in each piece of checked luggage</a>.”</p><p>Try to fit <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/how-to-travel-with-just-a-carry-on-goog_l_652d7e32e4b00565b6210f78\">everything into a carry-on luggage</a> to minimize the risk of losing your belongings in transit. </p><p>“Do not check a bag unless you have to,” Dengler said. “Lines are usually long during the holidays to drop bags off, and airlines have been known to lose or misplace luggage more often during busy times. Many non-basic economy tickets allow you to bring a carry-on and a personal item, so check your ticket’s baggage allowance.”</p><p>And if traveling with a checked bag is essential, try to book a nonstop flight. </p><p>“Transferring a bag from flight to flight is one of the primary reasons bags can be lost,” Nastro said. “You can decrease these odds by flying straight to your source when possible!”</p><div>Advertisement</div><h2><strong>Arrive early.</strong></h2><p>“Allow extra time for check-ins and security screenings to account for potential delays,” advised <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/travelwithmeko/\">Jessica-Kameko Rooks</a>, blogger at Travel With Meko. “Holiday travel, particularly when it involves air travel, can become notably stressful for several reasons.”</p><p>She pointed to the increase in the number of people traveling around the holiday season, which means crowded airports, long lines and packed flights. </p><p>“Additionally, heightened security measures during peak travel times can contribute to longer wait times and thorough screenings, making the overall experience more time-consuming and potentially frustrating,” Rooks added.</p><p>Give yourself enough buffer time to deal with the lengthy lines for security checkpoints and bag check counters (if you must). Consider enrolling in expedited security options like <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/tsa-precheck-global-entry-clear-explained_l_62955c5ce4b0415d4d890655\">Clear or TSA PreCheck</a> as well.</p><h2><strong>Get organized.</strong></h2><p>Staying organized goes a long way in reducing travel stress. Before your journey, make sure you have everything you need in order. </p><div>Advertisement</div><p>“Keep important documents, like your passport and boarding passes, easily accessible,” Glenn advised. “Have a designated spot for your travel essentials to avoid scrambling at security checkpoints.”</p><p>Don’t forget to prepare some entertainment as well. Glenn recommended packing books, and downloading movies and podcasts to keep yourself occupied during the journey.</p><p>“It can help distract you from any travel stress,” she added. </p><figure><img src=\"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/65800b592200005300faf0f2.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale\" /><span>Betsie Van der Meer via Getty Images</span><figcaption>Don\\'t forget to pack some patience, perspective and positivity. </figcaption></figure><h2><strong>Maintain perspective and a positive attitude.</strong></h2><p>Don’t forget to pack your patience, perspective and positive attitude. It will help with stressful moments.</p><p>“So your flight is delayed and you’re stuck in an airport for 15 hours? Make it an adventure,” Jerrard said. “You can choose to see things as a terrible way to spend the holidays, or as that memory that you and your kids tell for 20 years to come at the Christmas table, that you went on a treasure hunt through an airport on Christmas Eve.”</p><div>Advertisement</div><p>Embody the holiday spirit and look for moments of magic ― or create them yourself. Do what you can do, enjoy the ride and be present. </p><p>“Holidays don’t need to be perfect to be memorable, or to achieve what you want them to be,” Jerrard said. “Focus on what’s important to you instead. Are you delayed with your family in the airport? Start spending time together there. Are you in the airport solo? Use the downtime as an opportunity to start video calling people you wouldn’t have otherwise had the time to call.” </p><h2><strong>Take care of yourself.</strong></h2><p>“Stay hydrated and rested,” Glenn urged. “Travel can be exhausting, so prioritize self-care.”</p><p>She emphasized the importance of drinking plenty of water, getting sleep and taking breaks when needed during the stressful holiday travel season. </p><h2><strong>Consider travel insurance.</strong></h2><p>“Consider travel insurance for added peace of mind in case of unexpected events,” Rooks said.</p><p>Holiday travel often comes with inclement weather and unplanned cancellations, so do your research to <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/travel-insurance-pandemic_l_6091fb92e4b02e74d22cf5f6\">see if travel insurance is worth it</a> for your trip.</p><p>“I highly recommend that travelers buy travel insurance and also develop alternative plans for travel,” echoed <a href=\"https://diningtraveler.com/\">Jessica van Dop DeJesus</a>, founder and editor at The Dining Traveler. “The reality is that travel volume is at a record high, so travelers have to be patient and cover their costs.”</p><div>Advertisement</div><p>If your travel includes expensive non-refundable bookings that aren’t covered by your credit card’s insurance policy, then separate travel insurance might be the move. Compare plans and choose the best one for you. </p><h2><strong>Think about a solo trip.</strong></h2><p>“Try traveling solo,” suggested <a href=\"https://www.flashpack.com/\">Radha Vyas</a>, co-founder and CEO of adventure travel company Flash Pack. “When you’re only responsible for yourself, you can focus on what you really want to get out of the trip and allow your mind to broaden to new experiences and connections.”</p><p>There are countless advantages to solo travel, including the ability to move at your preferred pace and prioritize what matters to you. As we transition from 2023 into 2024, you might also benefit from taking the time alone to reflect on your experiences this past year and set goals for the new year.</p><h2><strong>Avoid holiday travel if you can.</strong></h2><p>“If possible, do not fly at all,” Dengler said. “While you can do everything right, traveling around the holidays is still stressful. The greatest risk is severe weather that grounds flights for more than a few days.”</p><p>Staying home can offer a truly relaxing and cozy holiday experience. If that’s not an option for you, however, try to be as flexible as you can with your dates. </p><div>Advertisement</div><p>“For example, my husband and I flew on Dec. 31 and rang the new year in the sky on our way to Peru, and we saved $150 per person by not traveling on Dec. 30,” van Dop DeJesus said. “It’s not about celebrating on an exact date but finding the way to share with your loved ones.”</p><h4>Support HuffPost</h4><h4>A No-B.S.

We asked a couple of travel experts to share their advice.</p><h3><strong>What To Know About Taking Wrapped Gifts On Flights</strong></h3><p>“Be sure to follow <a href=\"https://www.tsa.gov/travel/travel-tips/travel-checklist\">TSA guidelines</a> when packing,” said Cheryl Nelson<a href=\"https://www.preparewithcher.com/\">,</a> a travel preparedness expert and founder of <a href=\"https://www.preparewithcher.com/\">Prepare with Cher</a>. “While there aren’t specific gift wrapping restrictions, there is a chance your perfectly wrapped present with the curled bow could be unwrapped by a TSA agent if your luggage is flagged for safety inspection.”</p><p>Although there aren’t explicit rules that forbid it, TSA advises against wrapping your gifts before packing them in your suitcase since there’s a chance this could get undone in the security screening process. This guidance applies to both checked and carry-on luggage.</p><p>“Whether a wrapped gift is in a carry-on bag or checked luggage, if your luggage is flagged at TSA, your gift will be unwrapped,” Nelson said. “This could cause delays for you getting through TSA security and delay your checked luggage from making it on time for your scheduled flight departure.”</p><div>Advertisement</div><h3><strong>What To Do Instead</strong></h3><p>Understandably, you might not want to risk getting delayed or having your beautiful wrapping paper get torn up. But there are ways to be prepared without having everything fully gift-wrapped.</p><p>“You can keep your gifts in a gift bag or a box, but you’ll want to make sure that they can be easily opened by TSA agents if they need to be inspected,” said Lindsay Schwimer, a consumer travel expert with the trip-booking app <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com/?id=38395X987171&amp;xs=1&amp;xcust=656609abe4b028b0f3cdd982&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hopper.com%2F\">Hopper</a>.</p><p>Nelson offered some other suggestions for flying with presents as well.</p><p>“An easy alternative is to pack a gift bag and tissue paper and properly place your gift in the gift bag once you reach your destination,” she said. “If you really want to wrap your gift, pack some wrapping paper and tape, and save the gift-wrapping for your destination.”</p><p>If you feel strongly about fully wrapping your gift prior to air travel, you might also consider sending it separately to your destination via mail instead. </p><div>Advertisement</div><h3><strong>Other Things To Keep In Mind</strong></h3><p>As you prepare for your holiday flights, remember that everything you pack in your bag is subject to TSA regulations, including gifts. So if you got someone a set of nice hand lotions, make sure they’re carry-on size or put them in your checked bag.</p><p>“Travelers who are unsure if an item should be packed in a carry-on or checked bag should check the TSA homepage and reference the ‘<a href=\"https://www.tsa.gov/travel/security-screening/whatcanibring/all\">What can I bring?</a>’ section for the most up-to-date guidance,” Schwimer said. </p><p>Nelson noted that craft scissors are only permitted in checked luggage, so don’t try to toss them in your carry-on with other gift-wrapping supplies.</p><p>“Chances are that someone at your destination will likely have scissors you can borrow,” she added.</p><p>Nelson also offered a word of warning about a particular holiday favorite: the snow globe.</p><p>“If you plan to pack a festive snow globe in your carry-on luggage, remember that snow globes are considered liquids and anything liquid larger than 3.4 ounces ― roughly the size of a tennis ball ― will be flagged and confiscated by TSA agents,” she said. “If you plan to gift a snow globe, please carefully wrap it in bubble wrap for protection in your checked luggage.”</p><p>And remember: If you are flying this holiday season, be sure to take all the <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/travel-during-covid19.html\">proper precautions</a> to help reduce the spread of COVID-19. Wear your mask at the airport and on board, wash and sanitize your hands frequently, keep a safe distance from others when possible, and don’t fly if you’re feeling sick. </p><div>Advertisement</div><aside><a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/hygienic-airplane-bathroom_l_6183ec7ee4b055e47d76f69d\"><img src=\"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/61856318200000ec7f8d1fa3.jpeg?ops=210_120\" /></a><a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/airplane-seat-etiquette_l_61b7e8c4e4b0490e9bd740a4\"><img src=\"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/61ba3e782100006ee7701a17.jpeg?ops=210_120\" /></a><a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/secrets-about-flight-delays_l_61ae4192e4b025be1afb1e13\"><img src=\"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/61b12085260000cb733d017b.jpeg?cache=MWeSMR77Po&amp;ops=210_120\" /></a></aside></section></section><p>Do you have info to share with HuffPost reporters? <a href=\"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/securedrop\">Here’s how.</a></p><a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com\"> Go to Homepage</a></div>'}], 'summary': 'Experts explain what air passengers should know about traveling with presents.<br /><br /><hr /><br /><br /><div class=\"entry__content-list-container js-cet-unit-buzz_body\"><section class=\"entry__content-list js-main-content-list\" id=\"entry-body\"><section class=\"entry__content-list js-entry-content js-cet-subunit\"><p>Although the COVID-19 pandemic has forced many people to <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/17/well/live/omicron-holiday-travel-parties-testing.html\">alter their Christmas plans</a>, holiday travel still appears to be in full swing.

So if you got someone a set of nice hand lotions, make sure they’re carry-on size or put them in your checked bag.</p><p>“Travelers who are unsure if an item should be packed in a carry-on or checked bag should check the TSA homepage and reference the ‘<a href=\"https://www.tsa.gov/travel/security-screening/whatcanibring/all\">What can I bring?</a>’ section for the most up-to-date guidance,” Schwimer said. </p><p>Nelson noted that craft scissors are only permitted in checked luggage, so don’t try to toss them in your carry-on with other gift-wrapping supplies.</p><p>“Chances are that someone at your destination will likely have scissors you can borrow,” she added.</p><p>Nelson also offered a word of warning about a particular holiday favorite: the snow globe.</p><p>“If you plan to pack a festive snow globe in your carry-on luggage, remember that snow globes are considered liquids and anything liquid larger than 3.4 ounces ― roughly the size of a tennis ball ― will be flagged and confiscated by TSA agents,” she said. “If you plan to gift a snow globe, please carefully wrap it in bubble wrap for protection in your checked luggage.”</p><p>And remember: If you are flying this holiday season, be sure to take all the <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/travel-during-covid19.html\">proper precautions</a> to help reduce the spread of COVID-19. Wear your mask at the airport and on board, wash and sanitize your hands frequently, keep a safe distance from others when possible, and don’t fly if you’re feeling sick. </p><div>Advertisement</div><aside><a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/hygienic-airplane-bathroom_l_6183ec7ee4b055e47d76f69d\"><img src=\"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/61856318200000ec7f8d1fa3.jpeg?ops=210_120\" /></a><a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/airplane-seat-etiquette_l_61b7e8c4e4b0490e9bd740a4\"><img src=\"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/61ba3e782100006ee7701a17.jpeg?ops=210_120\" /></a><a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/secrets-about-flight-delays_l_61ae4192e4b025be1afb1e13\"><img src=\"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/61b12085260000cb733d017b.jpeg?cache=MWeSMR77Po&amp;ops=210_120\" /></a></aside></section></section><p>Do you have info to share with HuffPost reporters? <a href=\"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/securedrop\">Here’s how.</a></p><a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com\"> Go to Homepage</a></div>'}\n","Skipping already indexed news of title: Read This Before You Fly With Wrapped Gifts\n","--------------------------------------------------\n","{'title': 'A Reminder Of The Best And Worst TikTok Beauty Trends From 2023', 'title_detail': {'type': 'text/plain', 'language': None, 'base': 'https://morss.it/:clip/https://www.huffpost.com/section/style/feed', 'value': 'A Reminder Of The Best And Worst TikTok Beauty Trends From 2023'}, 'links': [{'rel': 'alternate', 'type': 'text/html', 'href': 'https://www.huffpost.com/entry/the-best-and-worst-tiktok-beauty-trends-in-2023_l_6580bfcde4b036ecab4634c0'}, {'length': '0', 'type': 'image/jpeg', 'href': 'https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/65846a162200003500ad3d87.jpeg?ops=224_126', 'rel': 'enclosure'}], 'link': 'https://www.huffpost.com/entry/the-best-and-worst-tiktok-beauty-trends-in-2023_l_6580bfcde4b036ecab4634c0', 'published': 'Fri, 29 Dec 2023 05:45:22 -0500', 'published_parsed': time.struct_time(tm_year=2023, tm_mon=12, tm_mday=29, tm_hour=10, tm_min=45, tm_sec=22, tm_wday=4, tm_yday=363, tm_isdst=0), 'id': 'https://www.huffpost.com/entry/the-best-and-worst-tiktok-beauty-trends-in-2023_l_6580bfcde4b036ecab4634c0', 'guidislink': False, 'comments': 'https://www.huffpost.com/entry/the-best-and-worst-tiktok-beauty-trends-in-2023_l_6580bfcde4b036ecab4634c0#comments', 'content': [{'type': 'text/html', 'language': None, 'base': 'https://morss.it/:clip/https://www.huffpost.com/section/style/feed', 'value': 'From hair slugging to pimple-popping, things got pretty ugly this past year.<br /><br /><hr /><br /><br /><section class=\"entry__content-list js-entry-content js-cet-subunit\"><p><a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/tiktok-products-that-make-life-easier_l_6543e9f3e4b00f9ca31f07ac\"><span>TikTok</span></a><span> has become the go-to source for beauty advice.

Instead of the simultaneous application of too many products, skin cycling helps simplify your topical routine. For example, night one may be ‘exfoliation’ night, night two is ‘retinol night’ and nights three and four are recovery nights so you hold off on the exfoliation and retinoids and give your skin a chance to recover.” </span><br /><br /></p><h3><strong>Strawberry Makeup </strong></h3><p><span>This fresh makeup look went super viral after Hailey Bieber posted a video tutorial on TikTok. </span></p><blockquote>  <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@haileybieber?refer=embed\" title=\"@haileybieber\">@haileybieber</a> <p>Everday Strawberry Makeup 🍓💋</p> <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/music/Echos-in-My-Mind-Lofi-7197097971182209025?refer=embed\" title=\"♬ Echos in My Mind (Lofi) - Muspace Lofi\">♬ Echos in My Mind (Lofi) - Muspace Lofi</a>  </blockquote> <p><span>“In my opinion, the strawberry makeup trend was the best beauty trend on TikTok in 2023. I liked it because it’s so cute and easily achievable. It really looks good on everyone and is relatively timeless,”</span> said <a href=\"https://kjhbrand.com/pages/about\"><span>Katie Jane Hughes</span></a><span>, a celebrity makeup artist (who has worked with Bieber) and founder of KJH.Brand.</span></p><h3><strong>Mascara Cocktailing</strong></h3><p><span><a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/mascara-cocktailing_l_643ff184e4b0d84038858c82\">Mascara cocktailing</a> involve mixing different mascara formulas to achieve your perfect look.</span></p><blockquote>  <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@katiehub.org?refer=embed\" title=\"@katiehub.org\">@katiehub.org</a> <p>@essence cosmetics , you amaze me😍 <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/fyp?refer=embed\" title=\"fyp\">#fyp</a> <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/mascara?refer=embed\" title=\"mascara\">#mascara</a> </p> <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/music/original-sound-7173016218415418158?refer=embed\" title=\"♬ original sound - katie\">♬ original sound - katie</a>  </blockquote> <p><span>“Makeup artists have been using this technique for years, layering and combining mascaras to give the eyes added definition,” said <a href=\"https://rubyhammer.com/pages/about-ruby-hammer\">Ruby Hammer</a>, a makeup artist and founder of Ruby Hammer Beauty. “Lashes are incredible at determining how your eyes look. Build volume and length in the center for a larger doe-eyed effect, or build up at the outer corners for a siren effect. Make sure to keep a clean spoolie on hand to avoid clumpy lashes, but enjoy experimenting with volumizing, lengthening, colored and defining formulations to enhance your eye shape.” </span></p><div>Advertisement</div><h3><strong>Strategic Camouflage</strong></h3><p><span>Spot concealing, or “strategetic camouflage,” is a clever way to use less product and make it work better for you, Hammer said. </span></p><blockquote>  <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@rubyhammermua?refer=embed\" title=\"@rubyhammermua\">@rubyhammermua</a> <p>Strategic Camouflage ♥️ One of my most frequently asked questions is how to hide pigmentation marks without it looking cakey… the magic is all in the application.

For the lightest, most natural-looking base, pick the smallest precision brushes to apply concealer, only to the areas that need attention. It looks like magic the first time you see someone following the technique! Using a precision brush pick up a small amount of product and place it onto the blemish you wish to conceal (no giant triangles or huge circles) and then tap in using your fingers. You can build up the coverage if you require more, but this will melt the product into your skin seamlessly. Then set with a translucent powder.” </span></p><h3><strong>Heatless Styling </strong></h3><p><span>So many people have tried some form of heatless styling in the past year (perhaps with a robe belt!) to give their hair a break. </span></p><blockquote>  <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@gjuanita?refer=embed\" title=\"@gjuanita\">@gjuanita</a> <p>Replying to @Dareen✨ results of heatless curls with a legging! <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/heatlesscurls?refer=embed\" title=\"heatlesscurls\">#heatlesscurls</a> <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/leggingcurls?refer=embed\" title=\"leggingcurls\">#leggingcurls</a> <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/overnightcurls?refer=embed\" title=\"overnightcurls\">#overnightcurls</a> <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/heatlesshairstyles?refer=embed\" title=\"heatlesshairstyles\">#heatlesshairstyles</a> <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/hairtok?refer=embed\" title=\"hairtok\">#hairtok</a> </p> <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/music/if-u-use-this-sound-ur-automatically-hot-7169370610677844741?refer=embed\" title=\"♬ if u use this sound ur automatically hot - 🎸\">♬ if u use this sound ur automatically hot - 🎸</a>  </blockquote> <div>Advertisement</div><p><span>“It’s refreshing to see the increase in heatless styling – less damage and breakage, especially if you’re a daily hair straightener user,” said <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com/?id=38395X987171&amp;xs=1&amp;xcust=6580bfcde4b036ecab4634c0&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fhourshaircare.com%2Fpages%2Fhour-story\">MariLynne Cosmillo</a>, the founder of Hours Haircare. “Understanding the best heatless wave or curl technique for your hair length and type will save you a lot of time. For example, robe curls are best for long hair, socks for short, and don’t skip the hair product – prep using a product with hold to set the curls, so you get the best results.”</span></p><h3><strong>Hair Oiling</strong></h3><p><span>Hair oiling is a 5,000-year-old tradition from India. But it’s become a big hit online lately, with people praising it for giving them longer, stronger and healthier hair.</span></p><blockquote>  <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@mypawfectfamily?refer=embed\" title=\"@mypawfectfamily\">@mypawfectfamily</a> <p>Every family has their own recipes, but this is how we’ve always done it:) <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/indianhairoil?refer=embed\" title=\"indianhairoil\">#indianhairoil</a> <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/indianhairsecrets?refer=embed\" title=\"indianhairsecrets\">#indianhairsecrets</a> <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/hairoiling?refer=embed\" title=\"hairoiling\">#hairoiling</a> <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/diyhairoil?refer=embed\" title=\"diyhairoil\">#diyhairoil</a> <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/hairgrowthtips?refer=embed\" title=\"hairgrowthtips\">#hairgrowthtips</a> </p> <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/music/Smiles-Sunsets-7060288450549549058?refer=embed\" title=\"♬ Smiles &amp; Sunsets - ultmt. &amp; Hz.\">♬ Smiles &amp; Sunsets - ultmt. &amp; Hz.</a>  </blockquote> <p><span>“Hair oiling can be beneficial when used correctly on non-oily scalps,” Cosmillo said. “Oiling the scalp is most helpful for strengthening the roots and preventing hair fall, although it comes with some terms. Only leave the oil in for up to three hours, and don’t over-apply, which can lead to overwashing. If you already have an oily scalp, this may not be the right treatment for you, as it can further clog your hair follicles and increased shedding.” </span></p><h2><strong>The Worst </strong></h2><h3><strong>Popping Pimples In The ‘Triangle Of Death’</strong></h3><blockquote>  <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@drjennyliu?refer=embed\" title=\"@drjennyliu\">@drjennyliu</a> <p>Don’t pop pimples, instread try spot treating with benzoyl peorxide, sal acid, or sulfure.

If bacteria gets into an open wound, an infection could develop. If this infection became serious and remained untreated, then expanded to the brain, then it could potentially prove fatal, as this region has veins that lead to the brain – causing blood clots, which could then lead to a stroke.</span></p><p><span>“However, the chances of this happening are low, and these infections are treatable with antibiotics. Although the odds are low, I wouldn’t recommend popping pimples in this region and if you do, watch for signs of infection.” </span><br /><br /></p><h3><strong>Nasal Tanning Sprays</strong></h3><p>This dangerous trend saw people using (illegal) <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/are-tanning-nasal-sprays-safe-tiktok_l_61f1ac9de4b0061af259bbd3\">nasal sprays to achieve a deeper tan</a> while using sunbeds.</p><p><span>“Also known as the ‘Barbie peptide,’ TikTok users are promoting nasal tanning sprays, which purportedly give users a deep tan through melanotan II, a lab-made ingredient that mimics hormones which already exist in your body to create a tan. Although this may sound promising for anyone looking to achieve a summer tan, the ingredient is actually illegal to sell in all 50 states, as well as in the U.K. and Australia,” Brauer explained. </span></p><div>Advertisement</div><p><span>″</span><span>It’s extremely dangerous, and just like sitting in a tanning bed, can be associated with melanoma,” he added. “Along with potentially causing cancer, tanning can cause premature aging. For a safer option, I’d recommend talking to a board-certified dermatologist to find a self-tanning lotion that works for you.” </span></p><h3><strong>Pinching Dark Undereye Circles To Figure Out The Cause</strong></h3><p><span>Dark circles can indeed be hereditary or acquired via aging, lifestyle factors and more. But you can’t determine the cause by pinching your under eyes. </span></p><blockquote>  <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@danicolexx?refer=embed\" title=\"@danicolexx\">@danicolexx</a> <p>A dark circles hack you need to know  <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/darkcircles?refer=embed\" title=\"darkcircles\">#darkcircles</a> <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/darkcirclesundereyes?refer=embed\" title=\"darkcirclesundereyes\">#darkcirclesundereyes</a> <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/skincare?refer=embed\" title=\"skincare\">#skincare</a> <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/tips?refer=embed\" title=\"tips\">#tips</a> <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/hyperpigmentation?refer=embed\" title=\"hyperpigmentation\">#hyperpigmentation</a> </p> <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/music/my-love-mine-all-mine-7286258568546962182?refer=embed\" title=\"♬ my love mine all mine - elle\">♬ my love mine all mine - elle</a>  </blockquote> <p><span>“It’s not always that easy to figure out the cause of dark undereye circles, and there are often multiple etiologies,” Brauer said. “These include, but are not limited to, aging skin and loss of elasticity, orbital bone resorption and hyperpigmentation.”</span></p><h3><strong>Underpainting</strong></h3><p><span>Underpainting is when you apply your contour, blush and highlighter before your foundation. The practice gained more traction on TikTok this year when Mary Phillips, who often does Bieber’s makeup, shared a video with the underpainting technique.</span></p><div>Advertisement</div><blockquote>  <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@nikkiajoy?refer=embed\" title=\"@nikkiajoy\">@nikkiajoy</a> <p>Guys I’m actually shook🤯Doing a full face of underpainting👀 <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/makeup?refer=embed\" title=\"makeup\">#makeup</a> <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/underpainting?refer=embed\" title=\"underpainting\">#underpainting</a> <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/underpaintingmakeup?refer=embed\" title=\"underpaintingmakeup\">#underpaintingmakeup</a> <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/makeuptrend?refer=embed\" title=\"makeuptrend\">#makeuptrend</a> <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/viralmakeuptrend?refer=embed\" title=\"viralmakeuptrend\">#viralmakeuptrend</a> </p> <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/music/Funny-Song-6732536571318257666?refer=embed\" title=\"♬ Funny Song - Funny Song Studio &amp; Sounds Reel\">♬ Funny Song - Funny Song Studio &amp; Sounds Reel</a>  </blockquote> <p><span>“Like many techniques on TikTok, they start with incredible artists sharing their wisdom — however, to go viral there needs to be a good visual impact so what starts as one thing very quickly turns into something else,” Hammer said. “Everyone has seen the before images of heavily applied stripes of concealer and large circles of blush that are then blended over with foundation. If you remember playing with paints as a child, you may remember that mixing all your colors at once left you with a brown sludgy mess and some of the after-effects I’ve seen have also resembled this. The art of underpainting is to be light-handed and strategic for a natural base effect.”</span></p><h3><strong>Sunscreen Contouring</strong></h3><p><span>We know the sun is dangerous, especially without adequate sunscreen protection. Contouring with sunscreen is not a good trend.</span></p><blockquote>  <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@shagzcantshred?refer=embed\" title=\"@shagzcantshred\">@shagzcantshred</a> <p>ill post my results if it works :) <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/contour?refer=embed\" title=\"contour\">#contour</a> <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/sunscreencontour?refer=embed\" title=\"sunscreencontour\">#sunscreencontour</a> <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/tancontour?refer=embed\" title=\"tancontour\">#tancontour</a> <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/selftancontour?refer=embed\" title=\"selftancontour\">#selftancontour</a> </p> <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/music/The-Bug-Collector-6694702985764669441?refer=embed\" title=\"♬ The Bug Collector - Haley Heynderickx\">♬ The Bug Collector - Haley Heynderickx</a>  </blockquote> <p><span>“This trend started in 2022 and continued into 2023; sunscreen contouring became a thing post-Gwyneth Paltrow’s infamous sunscreen routine video,” Hammer explained. “As an artist and beauty lover, this is one of the trends I have liked the least over the last year. No amount of contour is worth potentially damaging your skin. Instead, grab a bronzer and highlighter to give yourself a natural-looking glow that your skin will thank you for.” </span></p><div>Advertisement</div><h3><strong>Hair Slugging</strong></h3><p><span>Hair slugging may seem like hair oiling, which is a “good trend,” but a slugging routine leaves oil on the hair overnight, wrapped in a fuzzy sock. Leaving it overnight isn’t always ideal. </span></p><blockquote>  <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@vanesamaro91?refer=embed\" title=\"@vanesamaro91\">@vanesamaro91</a> <p>The oil im using is from @Fable &amp; Mane and you can find it on their website or sephora ❤️ discount code: vanesa15 <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/fableandmane?refer=embed\" title=\"fableandmane\">#fableandmane</a> <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/hairslugging?refer=embed\" title=\"hairslugging\">#hairslugging</a> <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/fableandmanepartner?refer=embed\" title=\"fableandmanepartner\">#fableandmanepartner</a></p> <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/music/original-sound-7125219137424608042?refer=embed\" title=\"♬ original sound - Vanesa Amaro ♥️\">♬ original sound - Vanesa Amaro ♥️</a>  </blockquote> <p><span>“If you’re using oil on your hair for an extended period, it should be on the lengths of your hair only – avoiding your scalp so it doesn’t clog your hair follicles,” Cosmillo said, noting that most of the hair slugging seen online is not done correctly. </span></p><p><span>“Slugging correctlyis beneficial if you oil with a high absorption rate such as coconut, sunflower, olive or castor oil, and find the right one for your hair porosity,” she said. </span></p><h3><strong>Hair Crackling Or Scalp Popping</strong></h3><p><span>This trend may seem satisfying, but it’s not good for the hair follicles. This trend involves quickly pulling the hair out of the scalp to make a popping sound, and <a href=\"https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a37909226/what-is-scalp-popping-galea-tiktok/\">purportedly has a few benefits</a>.

Instead of the simultaneous application of too many products, skin cycling helps simplify your topical routine. For example, night one may be ‘exfoliation’ night, night two is ‘retinol night’ and nights three and four are recovery nights so you hold off on the exfoliation and retinoids and give your skin a chance to recover.” </span><br /><br /></p><h3><strong>Strawberry Makeup </strong></h3><p><span>This fresh makeup look went super viral after Hailey Bieber posted a video tutorial on TikTok. </span></p><blockquote>  <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@haileybieber?refer=embed\" title=\"@haileybieber\">@haileybieber</a> <p>Everday Strawberry Makeup 🍓💋</p> <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/music/Echos-in-My-Mind-Lofi-7197097971182209025?refer=embed\" title=\"♬ Echos in My Mind (Lofi) - Muspace Lofi\">♬ Echos in My Mind (Lofi) - Muspace Lofi</a>  </blockquote> <p><span>“In my opinion, the strawberry makeup trend was the best beauty trend on TikTok in 2023. I liked it because it’s so cute and easily achievable. It really looks good on everyone and is relatively timeless,”</span> said <a href=\"https://kjhbrand.com/pages/about\"><span>Katie Jane Hughes</span></a><span>, a celebrity makeup artist (who has worked with Bieber) and founder of KJH.Brand.</span></p><h3><strong>Mascara Cocktailing</strong></h3><p><span><a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/mascara-cocktailing_l_643ff184e4b0d84038858c82\">Mascara cocktailing</a> involve mixing different mascara formulas to achieve your perfect look.</span></p><blockquote>  <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@katiehub.org?refer=embed\" title=\"@katiehub.org\">@katiehub.org</a> <p>@essence cosmetics , you amaze me😍 <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/fyp?refer=embed\" title=\"fyp\">#fyp</a> <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/mascara?refer=embed\" title=\"mascara\">#mascara</a> </p> <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/music/original-sound-7173016218415418158?refer=embed\" title=\"♬ original sound - katie\">♬ original sound - katie</a>  </blockquote> <p><span>“Makeup artists have been using this technique for years, layering and combining mascaras to give the eyes added definition,” said <a href=\"https://rubyhammer.com/pages/about-ruby-hammer\">Ruby Hammer</a>, a makeup artist and founder of Ruby Hammer Beauty. “Lashes are incredible at determining how your eyes look. Build volume and length in the center for a larger doe-eyed effect, or build up at the outer corners for a siren effect. Make sure to keep a clean spoolie on hand to avoid clumpy lashes, but enjoy experimenting with volumizing, lengthening, colored and defining formulations to enhance your eye shape.” </span></p><div>Advertisement</div><h3><strong>Strategic Camouflage</strong></h3><p><span>Spot concealing, or “strategetic camouflage,” is a clever way to use less product and make it work better for you, Hammer said. </span></p><blockquote>  <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@rubyhammermua?refer=embed\" title=\"@rubyhammermua\">@rubyhammermua</a> <p>Strategic Camouflage ♥️ One of my most frequently asked questions is how to hide pigmentation marks without it looking cakey… the magic is all in the application.

For the lightest, most natural-looking base, pick the smallest precision brushes to apply concealer, only to the areas that need attention. It looks like magic the first time you see someone following the technique! Using a precision brush pick up a small amount of product and place it onto the blemish you wish to conceal (no giant triangles or huge circles) and then tap in using your fingers. You can build up the coverage if you require more, but this will melt the product into your skin seamlessly. Then set with a translucent powder.” </span></p><h3><strong>Heatless Styling </strong></h3><p><span>So many people have tried some form of heatless styling in the past year (perhaps with a robe belt!) to give their hair a break. </span></p><blockquote>  <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@gjuanita?refer=embed\" title=\"@gjuanita\">@gjuanita</a> <p>Replying to @Dareen✨ results of heatless curls with a legging! <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/heatlesscurls?refer=embed\" title=\"heatlesscurls\">#heatlesscurls</a> <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/leggingcurls?refer=embed\" title=\"leggingcurls\">#leggingcurls</a> <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/overnightcurls?refer=embed\" title=\"overnightcurls\">#overnightcurls</a> <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/heatlesshairstyles?refer=embed\" title=\"heatlesshairstyles\">#heatlesshairstyles</a> <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/hairtok?refer=embed\" title=\"hairtok\">#hairtok</a> </p> <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/music/if-u-use-this-sound-ur-automatically-hot-7169370610677844741?refer=embed\" title=\"♬ if u use this sound ur automatically hot - 🎸\">♬ if u use this sound ur automatically hot - 🎸</a>  </blockquote> <div>Advertisement</div><p><span>“It’s refreshing to see the increase in heatless styling – less damage and breakage, especially if you’re a daily hair straightener user,” said <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com/?id=38395X987171&amp;xs=1&amp;xcust=6580bfcde4b036ecab4634c0&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fhourshaircare.com%2Fpages%2Fhour-story\">MariLynne Cosmillo</a>, the founder of Hours Haircare. “Understanding the best heatless wave or curl technique for your hair length and type will save you a lot of time. For example, robe curls are best for long hair, socks for short, and don’t skip the hair product – prep using a product with hold to set the curls, so you get the best results.”</span></p><h3><strong>Hair Oiling</strong></h3><p><span>Hair oiling is a 5,000-year-old tradition from India. But it’s become a big hit online lately, with people praising it for giving them longer, stronger and healthier hair.</span></p><blockquote>  <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@mypawfectfamily?refer=embed\" title=\"@mypawfectfamily\">@mypawfectfamily</a> <p>Every family has their own recipes, but this is how we’ve always done it:) <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/indianhairoil?refer=embed\" title=\"indianhairoil\">#indianhairoil</a> <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/indianhairsecrets?refer=embed\" title=\"indianhairsecrets\">#indianhairsecrets</a> <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/hairoiling?refer=embed\" title=\"hairoiling\">#hairoiling</a> <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/diyhairoil?refer=embed\" title=\"diyhairoil\">#diyhairoil</a> <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/hairgrowthtips?refer=embed\" title=\"hairgrowthtips\">#hairgrowthtips</a> </p> <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/music/Smiles-Sunsets-7060288450549549058?refer=embed\" title=\"♬ Smiles &amp; Sunsets - ultmt. &amp; Hz.\">♬ Smiles &amp; Sunsets - ultmt. &amp; Hz.</a>  </blockquote> <p><span>“Hair oiling can be beneficial when used correctly on non-oily scalps,” Cosmillo said. “Oiling the scalp is most helpful for strengthening the roots and preventing hair fall, although it comes with some terms. Only leave the oil in for up to three hours, and don’t over-apply, which can lead to overwashing. If you already have an oily scalp, this may not be the right treatment for you, as it can further clog your hair follicles and increased shedding.” </span></p><h2><strong>The Worst </strong></h2><h3><strong>Popping Pimples In The ‘Triangle Of Death’</strong></h3><blockquote>  <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@drjennyliu?refer=embed\" title=\"@drjennyliu\">@drjennyliu</a> <p>Don’t pop pimples, instread try spot treating with benzoyl peorxide, sal acid, or sulfure.

If bacteria gets into an open wound, an infection could develop. If this infection became serious and remained untreated, then expanded to the brain, then it could potentially prove fatal, as this region has veins that lead to the brain – causing blood clots, which could then lead to a stroke.</span></p><p><span>“However, the chances of this happening are low, and these infections are treatable with antibiotics. Although the odds are low, I wouldn’t recommend popping pimples in this region and if you do, watch for signs of infection.” </span><br /><br /></p><h3><strong>Nasal Tanning Sprays</strong></h3><p>This dangerous trend saw people using (illegal) <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/are-tanning-nasal-sprays-safe-tiktok_l_61f1ac9de4b0061af259bbd3\">nasal sprays to achieve a deeper tan</a> while using sunbeds.</p><p><span>“Also known as the ‘Barbie peptide,’ TikTok users are promoting nasal tanning sprays, which purportedly give users a deep tan through melanotan II, a lab-made ingredient that mimics hormones which already exist in your body to create a tan. Although this may sound promising for anyone looking to achieve a summer tan, the ingredient is actually illegal to sell in all 50 states, as well as in the U.K. and Australia,” Brauer explained. </span></p><div>Advertisement</div><p><span>″</span><span>It’s extremely dangerous, and just like sitting in a tanning bed, can be associated with melanoma,” he added. “Along with potentially causing cancer, tanning can cause premature aging. For a safer option, I’d recommend talking to a board-certified dermatologist to find a self-tanning lotion that works for you.” </span></p><h3><strong>Pinching Dark Undereye Circles To Figure Out The Cause</strong></h3><p><span>Dark circles can indeed be hereditary or acquired via aging, lifestyle factors and more. But you can’t determine the cause by pinching your under eyes. </span></p><blockquote>  <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@danicolexx?refer=embed\" title=\"@danicolexx\">@danicolexx</a> <p>A dark circles hack you need to know  <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/darkcircles?refer=embed\" title=\"darkcircles\">#darkcircles</a> <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/darkcirclesundereyes?refer=embed\" title=\"darkcirclesundereyes\">#darkcirclesundereyes</a> <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/skincare?refer=embed\" title=\"skincare\">#skincare</a> <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/tips?refer=embed\" title=\"tips\">#tips</a> <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/hyperpigmentation?refer=embed\" title=\"hyperpigmentation\">#hyperpigmentation</a> </p> <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/music/my-love-mine-all-mine-7286258568546962182?refer=embed\" title=\"♬ my love mine all mine - elle\">♬ my love mine all mine - elle</a>  </blockquote> <p><span>“It’s not always that easy to figure out the cause of dark undereye circles, and there are often multiple etiologies,” Brauer said. “These include, but are not limited to, aging skin and loss of elasticity, orbital bone resorption and hyperpigmentation.”</span></p><h3><strong>Underpainting</strong></h3><p><span>Underpainting is when you apply your contour, blush and highlighter before your foundation. The practice gained more traction on TikTok this year when Mary Phillips, who often does Bieber’s makeup, shared a video with the underpainting technique.</span></p><div>Advertisement</div><blockquote>  <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@nikkiajoy?refer=embed\" title=\"@nikkiajoy\">@nikkiajoy</a> <p>Guys I’m actually shook🤯Doing a full face of underpainting👀 <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/makeup?refer=embed\" title=\"makeup\">#makeup</a> <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/underpainting?refer=embed\" title=\"underpainting\">#underpainting</a> <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/underpaintingmakeup?refer=embed\" title=\"underpaintingmakeup\">#underpaintingmakeup</a> <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/makeuptrend?refer=embed\" title=\"makeuptrend\">#makeuptrend</a> <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/viralmakeuptrend?refer=embed\" title=\"viralmakeuptrend\">#viralmakeuptrend</a> </p> <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/music/Funny-Song-6732536571318257666?refer=embed\" title=\"♬ Funny Song - Funny Song Studio &amp; Sounds Reel\">♬ Funny Song - Funny Song Studio &amp; Sounds Reel</a>  </blockquote> <p><span>“Like many techniques on TikTok, they start with incredible artists sharing their wisdom — however, to go viral there needs to be a good visual impact so what starts as one thing very quickly turns into something else,” Hammer said. “Everyone has seen the before images of heavily applied stripes of concealer and large circles of blush that are then blended over with foundation. If you remember playing with paints as a child, you may remember that mixing all your colors at once left you with a brown sludgy mess and some of the after-effects I’ve seen have also resembled this. The art of underpainting is to be light-handed and strategic for a natural base effect.”</span></p><h3><strong>Sunscreen Contouring</strong></h3><p><span>We know the sun is dangerous, especially without adequate sunscreen protection. Contouring with sunscreen is not a good trend.</span></p><blockquote>  <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@shagzcantshred?refer=embed\" title=\"@shagzcantshred\">@shagzcantshred</a> <p>ill post my results if it works :) <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/contour?refer=embed\" title=\"contour\">#contour</a> <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/sunscreencontour?refer=embed\" title=\"sunscreencontour\">#sunscreencontour</a> <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/tancontour?refer=embed\" title=\"tancontour\">#tancontour</a> <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/selftancontour?refer=embed\" title=\"selftancontour\">#selftancontour</a> </p> <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/music/The-Bug-Collector-6694702985764669441?refer=embed\" title=\"♬ The Bug Collector - Haley Heynderickx\">♬ The Bug Collector - Haley Heynderickx</a>  </blockquote> <p><span>“This trend started in 2022 and continued into 2023; sunscreen contouring became a thing post-Gwyneth Paltrow’s infamous sunscreen routine video,” Hammer explained. “As an artist and beauty lover, this is one of the trends I have liked the least over the last year. No amount of contour is worth potentially damaging your skin. Instead, grab a bronzer and highlighter to give yourself a natural-looking glow that your skin will thank you for.” </span></p><div>Advertisement</div><h3><strong>Hair Slugging</strong></h3><p><span>Hair slugging may seem like hair oiling, which is a “good trend,” but a slugging routine leaves oil on the hair overnight, wrapped in a fuzzy sock.

This trend involves quickly pulling the hair out of the scalp to make a popping sound, and <a href=\"https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a37909226/what-is-scalp-popping-galea-tiktok/\">purportedly has a few benefits</a>.
