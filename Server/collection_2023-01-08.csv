And they continue to  regularly make new arrests , even as some Jan. 6 defendants are being released from prison after completing their sentences. Evan Vucci via Associated Press BY THE NUMBERS More than 1,230 people have been charged with federal crimes in the riot, ranging from misdemeanor offenses like trespassing to felonies like  assaulting police officers  and  seditious conspiracy . About 750 people have been sentenced, with almost two-thirds receiving some time behind bars. Advertisement Many rioters are already out of prison after completing their sentences, including some defendants who engaged in violence. Scott Fairlamb — a New Jersey man who punched a police officer during the riot and  was the first Jan. 6 defendant to be sentenced for assaulting law enforcement  — was released from Bureau of Prisons’ custody in June. ALL EYES ON THE SUPREME COURT Defense attorneys and prosecutors are closely watching a  case that will soon be heard by the U.S. Supreme Court  that could impact hundreds of Jan. 6 defendants. Lawyers representing rioters have argued the charge was inappropriately brought against Jan. 6 defendants. The justices will hear arguments in March or April, with a decision expected by early summer. Advertisement Several defendants have also fled after being charged, including a Proud Boys member from Florida who  disappeared while he was on house arrest  after he was convicted of using pepper spray gel on police officers. Olivia Pollock disappeared shortly before her trial  was supposed to begin in March. Another defendant,  Evan Neumann , fled the U.S. two months after his December 2021 indictment and is believed to be living in Belarus.

Sleiman first turned to comedy in 2021, after he was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis, a chronic illness that affects the central nervous system.","A reporter who was fired for his standup comedy has been reinstated to his job at a Philadelphia-based public radio station through an arbitrator, who agreed that his jokes were, in some part, funny. “So it was a lot of abuse from a lot of people who have never met me, who’ve never seen my stand-up just saw what WHYY said about me, which is not great.” A radio reporter fired from his job over his standup comedy act will be reinstated after an arbitrator declared that his jokes were actually pretty funny. Sorin Banica / 500px via Getty Images A message seeking comment emailed to WHYY was not immediately returned. Sleiman said he was considering further legal action for statements made by WHYY about his character. Sleiman had been working as a reporter on The Pulse, a nationally syndicated health and science program, since 2018 when he was terminated a year ago after executives found his social media account — under Jad S. or @jadslay — that posted clips of his standup comedy. Advertisement Officials at WHYY argued that his standup comedy violated the company’s code of conduct, social media guidelines and values of social responsibility, finding his routine to be “inflammatory.” They submitted nine videos from social media as their evidence. They argued the clips were “‘egregious’ in content, and had ‘sexual connotations, racial connotations, and misogynistic information,’ ” according to the arbitration documents. And I want to be an example of like, no, your employer doesn’t own you.” While arbitrator Lawrence S. Coburn conceded some or portions of the videos could be seen as inflammatory — “the very low standard in the Collective Bargaining Agreement that I am required to apply,” he wrote — he also found them to be sometimes “simply funny.” Advertisement In one, Coburn noted that some of the commentary was “insightful, principled and serious, but not very funny.” “More important, I find that the message of the clip, if one is open to receiving it, cannot be interpreted to be inflammatory,” he continued. For another, Coburn said “it is difficult to believe that a fair-minded person would find the clip inflammatory.” “But the bar is very low, and WHYY’s 1.3 million person audience might have a few people who would find the clip inflammatory,” he added. (Coburn found that, “under the circumstances, such ‘foolishness’ does not disqualify him from reinstatement.”) Advertisement Sleiman first turned to comedy in 2021, after he was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis, a chronic illness that affects the central nervous system. One of his biggest fears, he said, was losing fine motor function and, with it, his ability to play the guitar and piano. “These execs, they have no right to take that from me,” he said. I’m going to be a reporter and a comic, and I think there’s nothing wrong with that.” The arbitrator’s decision was issued Dec. 28.

Boeing said it was aware of the incident and was ""working to gather more information"" Plane was flying at more than 16,000ft (4,876m) when it began its emergency descent.","23 minutes ago About sharing By Kathryn Armstrong BBC News A passenger plane lost a section of its fuselage in mid-air, forcing it to make an emergency landing in the US state of Oregon on Friday. The Alaska Airlines Boeing 737 Max 9 returned to Portland 35 minutes into its flight to California after an outer section, including a window, fell. Alaska said 177 passengers and crew were on board. Boeing said it was aware of the incident and was ""working to gather more information"". ""A Boeing technical team stands ready to support the investigation,"" it said. According to flight tracking websites Flightaware and FlightRadar24, the plane was a Boeing 737 Max 9. Alaska Airlines said the incident happened shortly after departure and that the plane had landed safely back in Portland. ""While this type of occurrence is rare, our flight crew was trained and prepared to safely manage the situation,"" the airline said. It was flying at more than 16,000ft (4,876m) when it began its emergency descent, according to flight tracking data. Oxygen masks deployed during the incident, which began at 16,000 feet shortly after take off Images  sent to news outlets  show the night sky visible through a gap in the aircraft's fuselage, with insulation material and other debris also seen. Other pictures show the seat closest to the affected section, a window seat that passengers said was unoccupied, leaning forward without its cushion. The section of fuselage involved appears to be an area that can be used as an additional emergency exit door by some operators of the aircraft type, but not by Alaska. The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) wrote on X, formerly Twitter, that it was investigating the incident. The Boeing 737 Max has been described as ""the most scrutinised transport aircraft in history"" after a series of safety issues and investigations. The Max was grounded in March 2019 for a year-and-a-half after two of the type crashed in similar circumstances,  killing those on board . To fly again, each Max plane underwent significant modifications, although the changes would not be visible from the outside and passengers would not notice any difference. More recently, Boeing said it would increase the pace of 737 Max deliveries after resolving a supply error that required it to conduct lengthy inspections of new planes and its inventory, Reuters news agency reported. About 1,300 737 Max aircraft have been delivered to customers, Boeing data shows. Last month, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)  urged airlines to inspect Max models  for a possible loose bolt in rudder control systems.

He said this week there was a sense that politics just doesn't work anymore. Once upon a time there was another opposition leader, who had spent a few years in charge trying to shake up his party after it had been out of power for 13 years.

More than 700 Post Office branch managers were accused of wrongdoing after faulty accounting software made it appear money was missing. The Met said it was investigating possible fraud offences from these cases. It comes as 50 new potential victims of the scandal have contacted lawyers following an ITV drama about the issue. Neil Hudgell, a lawyer who acts for claimants, told the BBC that some of those seeking advice were former sub-postmasters who were prosecuted by the Post Office. The Met Police said the potential offences could have been related to ""monies recovered from sub-postmasters as a result of prosecutions or civil actions"". Between 1999 and 2015 more than 700 sub-postmasters were accused of wrongdoing based on information from a faulty accounting system, Horizon. The Metropolitan Police said on Friday evening,  as originally reported by the Times , that officers were ""investigating potential fraud offences arising out of these prosecutions"" which included ""monies recovered from sub-postmasters as a result of prosecutions or civil actions"". Some sub-postmasters wrongfully went to prison, many were financially ruined, forced to declare bankruptcy, while others describe being shunned by their communities following convictions for false accounting and theft. It focuses on the legal battle he led and won, paving the way for dozens of convictions to be overturned. ""But there's a small handful of people who were convicted that have come forward, three in total at the moment, which is obviously a tiny number proportionate to those that are still out there."" He also told the BBC that one of the three people that had been convicted has received inpatient psychiatric care. Mr Hudgell said the drama had brought to light the trauma of what the sub-postmasters went through: ""It's brought huge widespread sympathy to these people so alongside that, family encouragement and speaking to other postmasters that have been along this journey, they have found the courage to come forward."" ""It's more than any of us dared hope that it would move the campaign along, but sometimes drama can do that. And now: JUSTICE for the thousands affected,""  she wrote on X , formerly Twitter. Several financial compensation schemes have been set up to help those caught up in the scandal, although concerns have been raised about delays in payment. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak told reporters on Friday: ""It's important that all those affected get the support they need, which I am pleased is happening and we will keep going as quickly as possible."" Last month, a board overseeing compensation called for all Post Office staff wrongly accused of theft and false accounting  to have their convictions overturned . The Post Office has previously said it encourages ""people who believe they were wrongly convicted, for any reason, to consider an appeal"".

In an interview with the Guardian , Foster said she had sometimes found the attitudes to work she had encountered difficult to understand. But she did praise one Gen Z star, Bella Ramsey, calling the 20-year-old an example of an actor emerging in a new ""vector of authenticity"". Foster, who was a child star herself before going on to a glittering screen career, said she felt compelled to help young actors find their path ""because it was hard growing up"". 'Kind of limiting' Speaking about Gen Z - a term generally used to describe those born during the late 1990s and early 2000s - Foster, 61, joked: ""They're really annoying - especially in the workplace. ""Or, like, in emails, I'll tell them this is all grammatically incorrect, did you not check your spelling? Speaking about the advice she'd give to young people in the industry, she said: ""They need to learn how to relax, how to not think about it so much, how to come up with something that's theirs. ""I can help them find that, which is so much more fun than being, with all the pressure behind it, the protagonist of the story."" Jodie Foster said Bella Ramsey was an example of an actor emerging in a new ""vector of authenticity"" Foster singled out British actor Ramsey for praise, recalling how she first met The Last of Us and Game of Thrones star at Elle's Women in Hollywood celebration. Foster described it as a ""wonderful event"" but noted that all of the attendees were ""wearing heels and eyelashes"". ""There are other ways of being a woman, and it's really important for people to see that. And Bella, who gave the best speech, was wearing the most perfect suit, beautifully tailored, and a middle parting and no makeup."" Foster added that when she was young she would not have been able to dress like Ramsey in a suit and no make-up at a showbiz event. Because we didn't have freedom. And hopefully that's what the vector of authenticity that's happening offers - the possibility of real freedom,"" she added. Foster, who is tipped for another Oscar nomination for her role in Nyad, also spoke about her two sons and their attitude towards women. She explained that while they are now ""super feminist"", at one stage her older son believed he needed to be unpleasant to women to be a boy. The actor added: ""And I was like, no! That's not what it is to be a man!

Cameras followed Garraway as she got the family home ready for Draper's return. She instructed builders on where to install wheelchair ramps in her home, dealt regularly with doctors who discussed Derek's progress, and spoke to other people who were suffering the effects of long Covid. ""Is he going to be alive but no longer the same person? She concluded that it ""may be a rather beautiful thing as we might have to fall in love all over again"". So I feel like, that he would want his journey to be told"". He chose not to follow his boss into government after Sir Tony Blair's election victory, however, and instead became a political lobbyist. Draper denied any wrongdoing but the scandal - dubbed ""lobbygate"" - led to him being fired from his job. A decade later, he returned and founded the left-wing news website LabourList, but hit the headlines again when leaked emails revealed he discussed setting up a new blog called RedRag to peddle false rumours about Conservative MPs with Damian McBride, then a senior aide to then prime minister Gordon Brown. Draper later said he regretted his ""stupid, hasty reply"", adding that he should have ""said straight away that the idea was wrong"", but the story was enough to make him resign from his role as editor of LabourList and marked the end of his career at Westminster. She said spending time outdoors had become a ""lifeline for her family"" as she was planting fruit and vegetable seeds in the hope that they would be ready to eat when her husband came home. She said that by caring for her plants and ""not letting them die, it's doing something to keep the hope and spirit alive"", adding that gardening had helped create a more open dialogue with her daughter Darcey about Derek's condition. ""But when you're sitting there planting radishes, she would start asking the questions, and that allowed us to talk about it. Garraway admitted to experiencing loneliness as she became a carer for her husband, who still required around-the-clock support. ""I still hope we'll have a happy ending, but ultimately it just feels unsustainable,""she said. ""In such personal difficulties that they experienced, Kate was able to raise her head and speak to the rest of the caring community out there,"" said host Kaye Adams, ""and she was always aware of the many other people in this country who found themselves in a similar situation throughout Covid.""",2024-01-06 00:46:38,"[0.4373686548531916, 0.07390118496160836, 0.11153685764982492, 0.014339975468146913, 0.3601027115067452, 0.01381107281055083, 0.7919815374214452, 0.03317443277351017, 0.09575903580931311, 0.12066197399283035, 0.04299035691502529, 0.012489644426218038, 0.03677167187091847, 0.07290911578571041]",,Derek-Draper-How-Kate-Garraways-heartbreak-and-hope-captured-a-nation.wav

They suggest he wanted to scale back No 10's original plans. They also suggest he was reluctant to fund reception centres to accommodate migrants instead of using hotels or private housing because ""hotels are cheaper"". As prime minister, under pressure from his party, Mr Sunak has made the Rwanda plan one of his top priorities. The scheme to send some asylum seekers to Rwanda for processing and potentially resettlement, in order to deter people from crossing the English Channel in small boats, was first announced by then-Prime Minister Boris Johnson in April 2022. Mr Sunak - who became prime minister in October 2022 - was Chancellor of the Exchequer when the Rwanda policy was announced. The deal has been repeatedly delayed by legal challenges and no asylum seekers have been sent from the UK so far. They say, the ""chancellor wants to pursue smaller volumes initially, 500 instead of 1,500"" in the first year, and ""3,000 instead of 5,000 in years two and three"". Mr Sunak is also described as being reluctant to fund so-called ""Greek-style reception centres"", sites where migrants could be housed, rather than being put up in hotels which were said to be costing £3.5m a day at that point, the documents suggest. They say, the ""chancellor is refusing to fund any non-detained accommodation, eg Greek-style reception centres, because hotels are cheaper"". He is the first prime minster ever to oversee a reduction in small boat crossings, which were down by 36% last year."" In a statement, Labour MP and shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper said: ""This shows what an utter con the Tories' Rwanda scheme is and how weak Rishi Sunak has now become. ""The prime minister knew the plan was incredibly costly and wouldn't work, and resisted it while he was chancellor. ""Whether it be on Rwanda or hotel use, the Tories are continually going for gimmicks rather than ever getting a grip. ""It's time they gave up on this sorry charade and adopted Labour's plan to go after the criminal smuggling gangs, negotiating a new security deal with Europe to better protect our borders and set up a new returns unit to ensure those with no right to be in the UK are removed swiftly."" On arrival, they could be granted refugee status and allowed to stay. If not, they could apply to settle there on other grounds, or seek asylum in another ""safe third country"". The government said that  ""anyone entering the UK illegally""  after 1 January 2022 could be sent there, with no limit on numbers. But, so far, no asylum seeker has actually been sent.

The Ukrainian foreign ministry called the decree illegal. Russia insists it is moving the children out of harm's way. There has been an outpouring of support for Ukrainian children moved to Russia.,"26 minutes ago About sharing There has been an outpouring of support for Ukrainian children moved to Russia By Nadia Ragozhina BBC News Ukraine has condemned a decree signed by President Putin making it possible to confer Russian citizenship on Ukrainian children moved to Russia. Last March, the International Criminal Court issued an arrest warrant for President Putin over Russia's policy of forced child deportations. The Ukrainian foreign ministry called the decree illegal. However, Russia insists it is moving the children out of harm's way. On 4 January Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a citizenship decree expediting Russian citizenship to foreigners and stateless people. The Ukrainian foreign ministry singled out the passage saying that orphaned Ukrainian children or those deprived of parental guardianship can be fast-tracked to Russian citizenship by way of a presidential decision, or after a request by the institution holding them. The decree states that a citizenship application for such a child can be submitted by their legal guardian or the head of a Russian organisation responsible for the child. The Ukrainian foreign ministry sees this as Russia's attempt to solve its own demographic crisis, describing it as a violation of Ukrainian and international laws and children's rights. The decree is yet more evidence of Russia's policy of forced assimilation of Ukrainian children, and crimes against Ukraine in general, the ministry added. Ukraine's Commissioner for Human Rights, Dmytro Lubinets, says Moscow is granting citizenship to the children so that they are not regarded as Ukrainians who have been transferred to Russia. The Ukrainian authorities have identified over 19,000  Ukrainian children who have been deported to Russia since the beginning of the full-scale invasion in February 2022. Only 387 children have been brought back so far, according to the Ukrainian national database Children of war. In November 2023,  the BBC's Panorama TV programme revealed  that a political ally of Mr Putin adopted a child seized from a Ukrainian children's home. Sergey Mironov, the 70-year-old leader of a Russian political party, is named on the adoption record of a two-year-old girl who was taken in 2022 by a woman he is now married to, according to documents seen by Panorama. In March, the International Criminal Court issued an arrest warrant for Mr Putin for alleged war crimes in Ukraine. The ICC said he was responsible for for unlawful deportation of children from Ukraine to Russia. Maria Lvova-Belova, Russia's commissioner for children's rights, was hit with the same charges. ICC Prosecutor Karim Khan said children could not be ""treated as spoils of war"" and that it was possible Putin could stand trial.

By Friday evening, NuScale’s stock price had plunged more than 8% as investors sold off shares. In just the past two months, developers have pulled the plug on major offshore wind farms in New Jersey and New York after state officials refused to let companies rebid for contracts at a higher rate. But the financial headwinds are taking an especially acute toll on nuclear power. Many in the atomic energy industry are betting that  small modular reactors  ― shrunken down, lower-power units with a uniform design ― can make it cheaper and easier to build new nuclear plants through assembly-line repetition.

A rendering from the Idaho National Laboratory shows what NuScale's debut power plant was supposed to look like.

The NLRB officials allege in a complaint filed Wednesday that SpaceX interrogated workers about the letter and pressured them not to distribute it, according to board spokesperson Kayla Blado. The letter had directly criticized Musk’s behavior on social media. Advertisement The complaint also claims the company “invited employees to quit” and threatened them with termination for exercising their rights, Blado said. SpaceX, which is based in Hawthorne, California, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. It is against the law for employers to retaliate against workers for exercising “protected concerted activity,” or banding together with other workers in hopes of improving their working conditions. The workers who were allegedly retaliated against had criticized Musk's behavior on Twitter, now known as X. via Associated Press The charges submitted to the labor board alleged that after firing five workers, SpaceX continued a “campaign of retaliation and intimidation,” including “coercive interrogations” that led to another three terminations. They also said that during interviews, management showed workers screenshots from private Signal chat groups, making them believe they were being watched. One of the fired workers  told  The New York Times in November that “it was hard for me to believe what was happening, it was so brazen.”  Musk, the CEO of electric-vehicle manufacturer Tesla, created SpaceX in 2002 with the aspiration of one day sending people to Mars. He purchased X, then known as Twitter, in 2022 for $44 billion. Advertisement X has suffered from an exodus of advertisers no longer willing to promote their products on the platform under Musk’s management.

The ITC, a federal agency, ordered the halt in October to block Apple from using specific technologies underpinning a blood-oxygen measurement system in its Series 9 and Ultra 2 watches. Apple has been embroiled in an intellectual property dispute with the medical technology company Masimo over those technologies. The court’s action will allow sales of the two Apple Watch models pending its decision on whether to also permit sales as it weighs Apple’s appeal. The two watch models will be available at Apple’s online store by noon Pacific Time on Thursday, according to the company. They will return to some Apple stores Wednesday, with wider availability expected by Saturday. That dispute hasn’t directly affected Apple Watch sales yet because another regulatory body had ruled that AliveCor’s technology isn’t patentable. The legal tussle on that issue is still ongoing. The patent headaches facing Apple as it tries to infuse more medical technology into its watch models make it increasingly likely the company will either have to start working out licensing deals or simply acquiring startups specializing in the field, Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives predicted.

Behar suggested that murder is OK sometimes.","Gypsy Rose Blanchard  visited “ The View ” Friday and had to navigate a pretty uncomfortable on-air moment with co-host  Joy Behar . Blanchard, 32, was  released from prison last week  after serving nearly a decade behind bars for second-degree murder in the death of her abusive mother in 2015. Advertisement “If there is someone out there watching right now, p lease listen to me, heed my words, that you are not alone in this situation,” she said. “And I paid my dues for it.” “Oh, you mean  that  part,” Behar said with a sheepish smile, and began to backpedal. “Murder is wrong, Joy,” co-host Ana Navarro said, mock-patiently. “Yes, murder’s wrong,” Blanchard said with an awkward laugh. A clip of the moment  made its way onto X, formerly Twitter, where users certainly found humor in Behar’s seeming suggestion that murder is OK sometimes. Advertisement But many others agreed with Behar — who was likely referring to the horrific abuse Blanchard was forced to endure. Some people said that due to the circumstances of Blanchard’s case, they understood her actions. Advertisement Blanchard’s mother, Clauddine “Dee Dee” Blanchard, lied to her about her health since early childhood and made her believe she had several illnesses and conditions she did not actually have, including leukemia, muscular dystrophy, brain damage and an unspecified chromosomal disorder. Clauddine, who was also physically abusive, exploited Gypsy Rose’s fake illnesses for personal gain and convinced their community that the charade was authentic — which kept her daughter isolated and in a state of arrested development. Gypsy Rose realized later in life that she was not sick at all, and at age 19, she conspired with her then boyfriend, Nicholas Godejohn, to kill her mother. “But the one thing that I can do with it is some good.

He says a priest had to come and bless it before it left. Sir Patrick Stewart alleged in 2009 that he witnessed an apparition while performing “Waiting for Godot” in London.,"Andrew Lloyd Webber  says he’s never seen a  ghost  — but briefly once lived with one. Webber denied as much, before making an intriguing claim about his home in London. “I did have a house in Eaton Square which had a poltergeist,”  he told the outlet in an interview Tuesday . In the end we had to get a priest to come and bless it, and it left.” Advertisement This purportedly organized ghost starkly contrasts a traditional poltergeist, which remain unproven but are nonetheless known for their mischief, violence and noise. The term itself translates directly from German to “rapping” or “thudding” ghost. Webber’s home is notably situated in Belgravia, a central neighborhood  developed  in the 19th century by Marquess of Westminster, Robert Grosvenor. Sir Patrick Stewart  alleged in 2009  that he witnessed an apparition while performing “Waiting for Godot” with Sir Ian McKellen onstage in central London. “And it has stayed with me throughout my life. Because I always feel slightly foolish when I talk about this.” Webber at the 2009 premiere of his musical ""Love Never Dies"" in London. Even Sir Cameron Mackintosh, who produced “Phantom,” recently admitted to feeling something strange at a nearby theater. “As we gazed into the beautiful empty auditorium, we felt a chill and heard some slight sounds above our heads in the grid.” “In less than a minute, it was gone, but we both felt some presence,” he continued. He always turns up if you’re going to have a big hit!’” Webber’s neighborhood, meanwhile, has some rather historic ghosts to choose from. Past residents of Eaton Square include former prime minister Neville Chamberlain, his foreign secretary Lord Halifax and actor Vivien Leigh. Perhaps it was one of them who nightly tended to Webber’s papers — although a housekeeper certainly makes more sense.

The pair married privately in  Austin , Texas, where they reside to this day. They have two other kids in addition to Vida ― Levi, 15, and Livingston, 11. Despite some reported early tension  between Alves and her mother-in-law , the family appears rather close-knit,  judging  by  their social  media  posts .

Literally Media, which owns Know Your Meme, Cracked and other brands, acquired Mel for an undisclosed amount. Originally a content site for the Dollar Shave Club, Mel was once  “the rare men’s magazine.”","Men are so back: Mel magazine, an audacious digital media site for the guys, will get a new lease on life next year after its unceremonious dissolution in 2022. Literally Media, which owns Know Your Meme, Cracked and other brands, announced Friday that it acquired Mel magazine for an undisclosed amount. Originally a content site for the Dollar Shave Club, Mel was  once  “the rare men’s magazine that has taken upon itself to investigate masculinity, not enforce it.” Advertisement Oren Katzeff, CEO of Literally Media, told HuffPost that he wanted to acquire Mel for its unique voice and a loyal audience. When you make an acquisition like this, you have to be very respectful of that while also thinking about how to expand and grow the voice into the next chapter of the brand.” Mel doesn’t have an editor-in-chief or any writers yet, but the magazine will start publishing next year. Katzeff said he would like to have three to five people on staff with a mix of full-time and freelance employees and then “grow from there.” Katzeff said he plans to package Mel “with opportunities beyond the articles on site,” which will include a newsletter strategy as well as introducing video, which will open “more doors” to brand deals. Advertisement “There’s really a ripe opportunity for Mel to expand beyond just the website into at the very least video and possibly audio as well,” Katzeff said. “Literally Media as a company years ago was probably doing anywhere from 10 to 15 million video views a month, and now we’re doing in the hundreds of millions. So I’m pretty bullish in terms of Mel’s opportunity in both the video and audio space moving forward.” Mel magazine’s stories included headlines like  “Our Eternal Horniness for the Camp Counselor”  and  “I Tried Mark Wahlberg’s Catholic App to See If It Could Reconnect Me With God.”  Mel magazine reached 4 million unique monthly visitors during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, according to a news release, but in  March 2021, it ceased publication . A few months later, Recurrent Ventures acquired it only to pull the plug in 2022  and lay off all staff members . Mel magazine is the most recent digital media outlet Paste magazine acquired Jezebel , the women’s publication, after it shuttered in November. Katzeff said it’s “more challenging that ever” to run a successful media company. “I think we’ll be seeing more opportunities like these, I think we’ll be seeing more collaborations moving forward,” he said. “And, you know, what I hope with an acquisition like this is that we can also leverage some of the success we’ve had with our other brands to help revive some of the audience on Mel. “I think the power of a network is something that you get to enjoy that you don’t necessarily get as an independent entity. And so, my guess would be as we go into 2024, if the market conditions continue as they are, which is, again, greater challenges in terms of audience, greater challenges in terms of monetization, I think we may see more and more opportunities like these.” Advertisement Support HuffPost The Stakes Have Never Been Higher At HuffPost, we believe that everyone needs high-quality journalism, but we understand that not everyone can afford to pay for expensive news subscriptions.

Evan has been wrongfully detained for more than 250 days for simply doing his job as a journalist, and any portrayal to the contrary is fiction.

In the lawsuit, the two accused Lythgoe of sexual assault and battery, sexual harassment, negligence, gender violence and intentional infliction of emotional distress.

Nolan decided to use his acceptance speech as an opportunity to wax poetic about why he doesn’t care that an aerobics instructor hurt his feelings. “That’s a couple hours of my life I’ll never get back again!’” Nolan said.,"Christopher Nolan  really felt the burn during a   Peloton  class. The New York Film Critics Circle recently named the filmmaker best director for his movie “Oppenheimer,” and Nolan decided to use his acceptance speech as an opportunity to wax poetic about why he doesn’t care that an aerobics instructor hurt his feelings, according to  Variety . Advertisement To highlight this point, Nolan shared a personal anecdote. That’s a couple hours of my life I’ll never get back again!’” Nolan said. In today’s world, where opinions are everywhere, there is a sort of idea that film criticism is being democratized, but I for one think the critical appreciation of films shouldn’t be an instinct but it should be a profession.”  Although Nolan seemed to be joking while sharing this story, he may have been a bit irked by the flippant remark because he cranked it up again on his appreciation of film critics. “What we have here tonight is a group of professionals who attempt objectivity,” Nolan continued. “Obviously writing about cinema objectively is a paradox, but the aspirations of objectivity is what makes criticism vital and timeless and useful to filmmakers and the filmmaking community.” Advertisement Nolan didn’t name which of his movies was hated on or the name of the hater, but Peloton has a pretty massive fanbase, and it didn’t take long for its members to dig up the evidence. The Redditor appears to be right — and  404 published video of Sherman   absolutely going off on Nolan’s 2020 film, “Tenet.”  In the clip, which 404 says it found on Peloton’s official Facebook group Thursday, Sherman is working out to the song “The Plan” by Travis Scott. What the fuck was going on in that movie? And that’s two-and-a-half hours of my life I want back. I want it back.” So, uh, maybe Nolan has a point about film critics after all — especially when he concluded his speech by saying: “ In today’s world, as filmmakers you can’t hide behind authorial intent.

Fake shipping notifications are the top issue, followed by fraudulent products bought online. To avoid losing money, do a gut check with yourself about those deals you spot on the internet.","In a new AARP  survey  of 1,880 U.S. holiday shoppers, 80% of respondents said they’ve encountered holiday fraud, with fake shipping notifications being the top issue (53%), followed by fraudulent products bought through an online ad (38%). But often, you may not know the charity was a scam until it’s too late. Advertisement “A lot of times with charity frauds, victims don’t know that they’re actually a victim,” said Amy Nofziger, the director of victim support for the AARP Fraud Watch Network. “Any good, legitimate charity will take your money today, tomorrow, or the next day,” Nofziger said. “But of course, you either don’t receive the goods and now your payment information is exfiltrated.” To avoid losing money, do a gut check with yourself about those deals you spot on the internet. Nofziger said it’s a red flag if the seller has every size and color available when any other website is sold out of that item. If it’s a seller on Facebook Marketplace, avoid listings that  only list peer-to-peer payment systems  like Venmo, CashApp or Zelle as an option because scammers prefer these untraceable and unretractable forms of payment. Advertisement That’s because scammers are known to tamper with gift cards on display racks and set it up so that  when you register to activate them, the scammer will be notified  and they can spend or transfer the funds before you or your gift recipient can use it. Some scammers impersonate airline customer service agents to get your personal and banking information. Because imposters often make fraudulent airline websites, Nofziger said you should also be wary of clicking airfare links you found via a search engine result and instead should go directly to the airline’s website. And actually, I can offer you a $50 discount if you can get me an Amex [American Express] gift card because we’re running a special with Amex,” Nofziger said as an example. “We’re seeing the injection of malware on merchant checkout pages,” Jabbara said. It also helps to check the seller’s reviews and see if they have had a large number of disputes and chargebacks in the past because that’s a red flag, Jabbara said. “You might get a text message from FedEx or USPS saying that they weren’t able to deliver a package because there was missing information on your account: ‘Just click here to fill the information out, your package will be coming,’” Nofziger said as an example. Beyond avoiding suspiciously misspelled text messages, keep track of what you’re buying to know who delivers your package and when. 10'000 Hours via Getty Images Shipping scams can be incredibly common during the holidays. Your options are more limited if it is with cash or not on a card. “If you’re using a peer-to-peer app or using cash or wire transfer or some of non-card payment method, your recourse is somewhat more limited and undefined,” Jabbara said, noting that whether you get money back will depend on the service’s specific policies, and sometimes “it’s kind of a ‘you’re on your own approach.’” Report the scam to authorities. Help prevent others from getting scammed by filing a complaint with the Federal Trade Commission  online  or calling 877-382-4357.

Setting clear limits for different holiday spending areas will help you avoid making impulse purchases. Emotional spending can be a big problem around the Holiday season, which tends to bring up childhood memories and a sense of pressure.","The holidays are an exciting time for parties, sweet treats, shiny decor and family gatherings. “Maintaining financial boundaries during the holiday season is crucial for several reasons.” Advertisement Stevens emphasized that it’s important to resist the temptation to overspend so you can avoid accumulating debt, foster healthy relationships, minimize stress and model financial responsibility. “I think it’s important to decide on a holiday budget well in advance of the holiday season ― this can include travel, food and gifting expenses,” said Samantha Gorelick, managing financial planner at  Brunch & Budget . “Some folks save all year long for the holiday season, but if you didn’t prepare that far in advance, decide now on an amount you will spend and try your best to stick with it.” Advertisement Setting clear limits for different holiday spending areas will help you avoid making impulse purchases. Doing so can cause you to derail your long-term savings goals.” Make a list (and check it twice). “Put the amount you are willing to spend next to each item and/or person before you start shopping, and please, please update it in with your actual spending as you go,” said Anne Lester, a retirement savings expert and author of the upcoming book  “Your Best Financial Life.” She emphasized how easy it is to spend beyond your means, particularly in this era of apps and browser extensions that effectively gamify the process of purchasing expensive items and experiences. Advertisement “It’s important to set realistic and effective boundaries that will make you consider if the thing you are about to get for yourself or someone on your list is really something that is needed ― or even truly wanted,” Lester said. “With high rates of inflation, don’t feel shame if your holiday season might look different than years past,” Howard said. “There might be less gifts under the tree, but maybe they’re more meaningful this year ― like a coupon book for your significant other or spending time with your family on a service project. We should all extend a little more grace this holiday season when it comes to spending.” Start new traditions. But the internet and social media have made it all too easy to fall into that trap. “I think one of the reasons that it becomes easy to violate or ignore financial boundaries is because of the value we’ve been taught spending and overspending on gifts means, as it relates to showing care and showing love,” Stevens said. “In other words, we’ve been taught by the media and our peers that spending equals love, when that’s not necessarily true.” Take the time to consider the beliefs and values you developed growing up, and whether you want to carry them into your holiday spending as an adult. Additionally, each of my kids will receive up to three gifts and one of the gifts will be something that can be used on vacation.” Advertisement Avoid emotional spending. “When it comes to setting financial boundaries this holiday season, be hyper-aware of emotional triggers, social pressure, [fear of missing out] and today’s gift-giving culture,” Howard said. “If you are overspending, explore where you learned this behavior and dig for the root issue behind the spending.” Emotional spending can be a big problem around the holiday season, which tends to bring up childhood memories and a sense of pressure to achieve Hallmark-style “perfection.” “If you feel a rush from shopping, understand your purpose of spending,” Howard said. “Protecting yourself from yourself might look like knowing exactly what gifts you’re buying for others, or only shopping online to reduce extra purchases in store.” Prepare to save after the holidays. So, after the holidays, make a conscious effort to spend less than usual for a couple of months to make up for any overspending during the holidays.” Advertisement Think about your future self. “Think about the dreams you are working towards and how the decision of saving that money today instead will help you get there faster, instead of spending it on a portable monitor or a spin scrubber on TikTok Shop, no matter how many coupons they give you!” she said. “I can’t emphasize enough how important it is to think about taking good care of your future self as well as your current self.” Do you have info to share with HuffPost reporters?",2023-11-28 10:45:01,"[0.005289374315590222, 0.9987034536624237, 0.00423334765024712, 0.003219250322545984, 0.023540948114686808, 0.0020036398095970597, 0.006170559111596406, 0.006060585892154139, 0.015344384035649609, 0.006880504198747887, 0.002811044183811487, 0.002384798008198301, 0.03496734987089634, 0.019571811311144976]",,The-1-Thing-You-Need-To-Do-Before-You-Start-Holiday-Shopping-This-Year.wav

Here’s How To Spot The Toxic Spending Habit.,"""Spaving"" is the act of spending money to save money. Sales create a sense of urgency with buzzy terms like “one day only,” “limited time, “daily deal” and “flash sale” Avoid sale alerts or bricks-and-mortar stores that tempt your spaving impulses.","But other practices are more sneakily harmful ― like “spaving.” “Spaving is the act of spending money to save money,”  Andrea Woroch , a consumer finance and budgeting expert, told HuffPost. “The problem with spaving is that it can trick you into spending more in order to receive a certain savings benefit in return,” said Jacqueline Howard, the head of money wellness at Ally Bank. “Because of the incentive, it’s easy to feel better about adding a few more items to your cart, even if you weren’t planning on making those additional purchases,” Howard explained. Woroch noted that sales create a sense of urgency with buzzy terms like “one day only,” “limited time, “daily deal” and “flash sale” ― making customers feel like they’ll waste a rare opportunity if they don’t pounce. “The reality is, retailers are constantly rolling out new sales, so just because you miss out on a sale today doesn’t mean you can’t get the same item on sale later,” she explained. Many people also feel a sort of high when they score a good deal on an item, regardless of how much they wanted or needed it in the first place. “Even if you get something at a really good sale price, you’re still spending money that could be going towards something more important, like building your savings, paying down debt, investing, etc.,” Woroch said. “A few bucks here and there adds up and can put a huge dent in your overall budget.” Then there’s the fact that sale items often come with limited or nonexistent return policies. Advertisement For some people, spaving leads to credit card debt, which can mean paying interest that far exceeds whatever was saved in the sales deal. Remove the temptation to spave by avoiding sale alerts however possible. “Create a list before you go shopping and stick to it,” Howard suggested. Plus, you can look around your home or closet to see if you already have something like it — because if you do, even another $10 is unnecessary to spend.” She recommended implementing a 24-hour waiting period to confirm that you don’t have the item or something similar, as well as to shop around, compare prices or even look for a refurbished option. Ask yourself, how will you feel about this purchase in three, six or nine months from now?” Westend61 via Getty Images Try to avoid sale alerts or bricks-and-mortar stores that tempt your spaving impulses. “Stay out of stores that have too many deal temptations,” Woroch said. And be on alert whenever you have to shop in person. “Use browser tools that do the deal hunting for you so you don’t get tempted by another sale when looking for a relevant coupon.” She recommended  PriceBlink , which runs an instant price comparison when you’re looking at a product online and presents other sites that are selling the same item for less, as well as  Sidekick  from  CouponCabin . “The time it takes you to fetch your credit card, the urge to buy should pass, helping you avoid an unnecessary purchase.” Advertisement Do a spending audit. “It’s also a good idea to take a look at just how much you’ve spent over the year so far on excess purchases, which can be eye-opening and give you a little fuel to make changes.” She also recommended thinking about the emotions driving your impulse spaving purchases. “Every time you’re tempted to spave, just think about how that money can go towards helping you reach your goal faster.” Advertisement Stop comparing yourself with others. “When we compare our experiences to that of others, we often lose sight of our values and overspend.” You’ve likely heard the expression “keeping up with the Joneses,” which speaks to the social pressure that many people feel to buy things.",2023-11-09 10:45:00,"[0.0033113563211725075, 0.999322482250679, 0.003200786709073275, 0.002208919666158241, 0.012653730581325143, 0.001339692536485159, 0.0063664468041792115, 0.003374788650275721, 0.010860994350459941, 0.004214396382028312, 0.0028219509936803066, 0.0018680627560594594, 0.029959724231651275, 0.008360265061123954]",,Are-You-Guilty-Of-Spaving-Heres-How-To-Spot-The-Toxic-Spending-Habit.wav

I honestly prefer to preserve my energy and over-communicate when it’s drastically needed.” Why Gen Z Prefers More Solo Work At work, Gen Zers’ independence can sometimes create the negative reputation that they are disengaged from the rest of their team. When asked, Gen Z workers said that there is more nuance in why they might want to work alone than these generalized findings suggest. But at the same time, he appreciates when there are colleagues around, too. He said Gen Zers might prefer doing things solo because they work in a judgmental environment. They might be in a workplace where they cannot listen to music uninterrupted, or where eating a snack during a meeting could cause colleagues to think, “Oh, is this really the time to be eating?” With other colleagues present, “you kind of have that magnifying glass on you,” he said. Lopez said that managers can also misconstrue Gen Z colleagues not showing up to the office as a lack of team spirit. What Gen Z And Older Generations Can Learn From Each Other Fernandez said that there should be flexibility for remote work and working alone, but said it can also be helpful for Gen Z professionals to know that “you cannot be efficient with people. As logical as we are, we are emotional beings.” Advertisement Even though it can be inefficient, physically showing up at work can increase relationship-building, and it’s “where you learn to manage dysfunctional teammates, where you learn to negotiate or, frankly, even influence others about your idea,” she said. Guevara said that when he advises Gen Z friends who work remotely and alone, he asks them to separate the situations where it’s comfortable to work alone versus where it’s necessary. “If you need music to work, that’s one thing,” he said. In a 2022 Gallup  poll , Gen Z was the demographic most ambivalent and disengaged with the workplace, but it was not because young workers were slacking off and not caring about their jobs. Most reported missing a close connection to their colleagues, manager or employer. When Fernandez teaches university students, she said that she asks for class volunteers to be her internal focus group, so they can tell her what’s working and what’s not in the classroom. “[Gen Z is] going to be the next set of managers,” Fernandez said. “There’s that preconceived notion that ‘Gen Z is lazy, Gen Z doesn’t like working with other people’ that they’ll use to influence how they approach a situation with someone who happens to be Gen Z.” Advertisement Guevara said that he has Gen Z friends who “get talked down to” by others at work, “as if they don’t know what they’re talking about.” “The way that they talk to people is obviously going to have an impact, especially when there’s a huge age difference,” he said.

Voluntelling If you’ve been quote-unquote “volunteered” for an assignment you didn’t ask for, you’ve actually been “voluntold.” It’s a phrase that was  popularized  by the U.S. military to describe situations where somebody is volunteered for a task without getting the opportunity to say “no,” and with implicit pressure to say “yes.” At work, these assignments may not sound exactly like marching orders, but deep down, you know they are. Advertisement A term like “‘hey’ hanging” perfectly describes the anxiety co-workers may be causing with their messages.

Body Doubling If you work best with an accountability buddy, try a work exercise known as “ body doubling .” With this technique, commonly used by professionals with ADHD, you do a task and have another person on Zoom or in person doing a task too. You might already be doing body doubling without knowing it has a name. It can mean working quietly with a friend in a coffee shop, or it can mean having them finish the same task as you at the same time. Either way, try out this hack if you have trouble concentrating or finishing tasks. Post-Work Restraint Collapse If you’ve ever felt like screaming into a pillow or lying on your couch after a hard day at work, you might be feeling something known as “ post-work restraint collapse .” It’s a concept that therapists are using to describe the bone-deep exhaustion caused by draining work days. Post-work restraint collapse can look like “a sense of depletion and having nothing left for other activities, even things that you might really enjoy, like exercise, spending time with your family or other social activities,”  Emily Treichler , a licensed clinical psychologist, previously told HuffPost about post-work restraint collapse.

Newcastle won’t care how the win was achieved, and nor should they. Without being anywhere near their best they were much the better side. Joelinton suffered a thigh injury in twisting awkwardly and was forced off.","The word from the club was always that Howe’s job was safe, but no manager could feel entirely secure after a run of eight defeats (one of them on penalties) in nine games that saw his side go out of three competitions, with their hopes of qualifying for next season’s Champions League significantly diminished. Quick Guide How do I sign up for sport breaking news alerts? One win does not entirely dispel the disquiet, and the run is still seven defeats ( one of them on penalties ) in nine games. An uneasiness may return after the league games against Manchester City and Aston Villa later this month. But Howe won the one game that might really have hurt him and, in doing so, ended a run of nine derbies without success and levelled the overall score in this fixture at 54 wins each. The football itself came as something of an anti-climax. In truth,  Sunderland  never looked like causing an upset. Sunderland didn’t manage a shot in the first half and didn’t really look like having one until they were already 2-0 down. There were a welter of bad touches, misplaced passes and an evident nervousness. That’s been one of Sunderland’s biggest problems this season: they are a team set up for dominating possession and when they cannot do that, they are very lacking in creative options – or even in ways to take goal-kicks; the attempts to play them short seemed only to invite pressure. As if that weren’t generous enough, Pierre Ekwah (from a free-kick for offside taken short) gifted Newcastle their second moments after half-time before Clarke sloppy concession of possession and Ballard’s clumsy challenge gave away the late penalty. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to  Football Daily Free daily newsletter Kick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of football Privacy Notice:  Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties. Newcastle won’t care how the win was achieved, and nor should they. Without being anywhere near their best they were much the better side and never looked in any danger. From that point of view it was a job done extremely efficiently and they can argue, not without justification, that they forced the errors. It’s not their fault Sunderland were so willing to make them, or that they looked so obviously the side from the lower division. This was a game in which Newcastle had very little to win and a lot to lose; what mattered was getting the job done, stopping the rot and getting out having sustained as little damage as possible. That Joelinton suffered a thigh injury in twisting awkwardly and was forced off just after half-time, though, comes as a blow and, in that context, it’s surprising Howe didn’t make any other substitutions until the 90th minute. Howe can now get on with trying to get Newcastle firing again as they were in early autumn and qualifying for the Europa League, or perhaps the Champions League and if something develops in the FA Cup, that’s a bonus. The  fixture that could have hurt him  is done and a win in the derby can now be added to his list of achievements, which is more than his four predecessors can say.",2024-01-06 16:15:18,"[0.003965143215629548, 0.003962266485095594, 0.003340915633310686, 0.0038204026154635188, 0.0039612767394384425, 0.004270362226191394, 0.0035839598224195694, 0.005362592812076416, 0.00378449889001947, 0.0022265921181637573, 0.0020343296918366475, 0.9999027878355127, 0.002397528149442593, 0.005704306222432571]",,Howe-avoids-damaging-Newcastle-defeat-to-secure-valuable-respite--Jonathan-Wilson.wav

Before Warner had even produced the kind of crash-bang-wallop knock he was picked for, which he did  by teeballing 180  against India in Perth, he had already proved his variety and worth, carrying his bat on a Hobart greentop for 123 in his second Test as the rest fell around him and New Zealand won by seven runs.

And yet he still barely seems to have pulled on the shirt, or got past his moody online announcement clip. The news that  Sancho will be loaned back to Borussia Dortmund  as soon as a deal can be hatched should at least bring this strange, dislocating interlude to a close. Although not with any actual resolution, more a sense of something deeply odd having just taken place, a failure that sits outside the regular rules of outrage and reckoning-up. There is a goal against Köln on his Bundesliga reel where the ball trickles along in front of him and he doesn’t even pretend to touch it, just feints to move three times, making the defender in front of him literally fall over backwards through sheer balletic misdirection. But not in Manchester, where he has instead seemed to be operating under the heaviest gravity, a character from another movie altogether. Sancho failed to recognise his own privilege, the precarious nature of talent. Here we have a sensitive young man exposed to the open reactor core. Sancho had never actually played a club game in England before he came back. He arrived in the post-Covid lull of 2021 , our summer of arse-cheek rocket launches, and was shunted straight into the Solskjær-Rangnick-Ten-Hag non sequitur and told to save this thing. The Manchester United shirt has proved to be too heavy for Jadon Sancho since his big-money move from Borussia Dortmund.

The Wearsiders are now Championship residents but more than £500m has been spent on Newcastle's squad. The teams’ fortunes have certainly diverged since March 2016 when Rafael Benítez’s Championship-bound, Mike Ashley-owned Newcastle drew 1-1 at home.","The San Siro-bound Milanese metro carriage was uncomfortably overcrowded and the handful of locals on board looked distinctly uneasy as visiting Newcastle fans chanted three words at full volume. The Wearsiders are now Championship residents but, whereas their current squad cost about £20m to assemble, more than £500m has been spent on Newcastle’s. It dictates that what once ranked as a clash of near equals would normally appear an embarrassing  FA Cup  third-round mismatch. Yet given Eddie Howe’s visitors are scarred by a run of seven defeats in eight games and have not beaten their local rivals since 2011, a distinct nervousness permeates the Tyneside air. They must avoid all conventional forms of public and private transport and traverse the 14 miles separating the cities on a convoy of free buses flanked by heavy-duty police escorts.

Moreover, although Kyril Louis-Dreyfus cannot remotely rival the Saudis’ wealth, Sunderland’s Swiss-French majority owner is a billionaire.

That is sure to suit  Georges Saint (2.40) , a winner on bottomless going at Ffos Las and Fakenham already this season, and Venetia Williams’s gelding is a solid bet at around 5-2 to land another decent prize for a stable that is already showing a 44-point profit to level stakes this season.

For 14 grueling rounds, Ali and Frazier exchanged punishing blows, each refusing to yield. Ali, summoning every ounce of his resilience, launched a ferocious assault in the 15th round, battering Frazier relentlessly.

Lionel Messi mentioned his urged to leave Barca in an official note.","Lionel Messi’s father and agent Jorge Messi insist that Barcelona’s €700m release clause is “not applicable at all and his son should be able to leave the club for free. However, a statement was released shortly by La Liga after Messi’s declaration. The statement said that the clause needs to be paid if Messi is to be allowed to leave Barcelona. Jorge Messi claims the massive clause which  Barcelona  added in his son’s contract as insurance has expired at the end of last season. If Jorge could prove this as the case, the Argentine international could leave the club for free this month, should all parties reach an agreement. Lionel Messi mentioned his urged to leave Barca in an official note. Following that, didn’t show in the club’s training after new manager Ronald Koeman was signed.

Jorge Messi statement Jorge released a statement on behalf of his son. The statement said We don’t know what contract they have seen and analyzed to back the claims only the buyout clause is applicable even if the player decides to unilaterally terminate his contract after the 2019/2020. This must be a major error on their own part. He added by saying, It is obvious that the compensation of €700m doesn’t apply at all. La Liga said it had analyzed the player’s contract which remained valid with an active release clause. And Messi won’t leave the club if the clause is not been paid. Messi claimes he triggered an exit clause in his contract which he could do as soon as the season finished. Barcelona claimed the clause has expired before June 10.

Manchester City is the only club that has shown huge interest and seems to be the possible place for Messi.

SPORTbible leads by example to optimise blog posts on X Considering many brands and personalities still getting used to the adaptations being made on X, promoting blog posts has been a big topic of discussion. Typically, in this era of sports journalism, clickbait headlines are a strong theme for encouraging consumers to click through to external content across the web. On X, this can be optimised through an engaging post, followed by a thread following the link to where you want your potential consumer to follow through. To repurpose this on other channels, you can create a reel on IG/TikTok and communicate with others by clicking the link in your bio.

From a marketing perspective, this is a good move for brands, fighters and marketers to raise awareness.","On this week’s combat sports marketing blog post, we dig into optimising pinned posts on X, raising awareness of other channels through reels, methods to engage your community despite what channel you’re on, and superb tactics to maximise YouTube marketing. Take notes from Joe Joe Giannetti about optimising pin posts on X Cage Titan’s superstar, Joe Joe Giannetti, caught my eye while scrolling through my X feed, and I am super impressed with how he’s marketed his pinned post. When you’re a fighter, it’s essential to clarify your intentions as you’re trying to become a superstar. Plus, he’s taken the time to pay meticulous attention to detail in content creation. As a fighter, it’s key to showcase your passion AWAY from the cage when engaging with your audience. Sports fans, in general, are interested in the entertainment factor rather than just the fighting, and that’s exactly what Joe Joe’s pinned post illustrates. Where’s the value in recognising user-generated content? None other than UFC welterweight Shavkat Rakhmonov featured in a collaborative Instagram reel this week via espnmma & SportsCenter due to himself missing his sister’s wedding due to the undefeated welterweight competing at UFC296 against Stephen Thompson. This reel showcased a clip captured via a user-generated content account dedicated to the 17-0 fighter, which appears to be identified on X. From a marketing perspective, this is a good move for brands, fighters and marketers to raise awareness via a single post to make your audience notice other channels you’re present on, meaning they’re more likely to give you a follow or engagement, which can only benefit your brand.

This is an important habit for fighters, brands, and marketers to get into when establishing a community via social media, as it helps with loyal supporters of your brand, which can pay long-term dividends.

The commission will investigate whether the company complied with its obligations under new European data protection laws that came into effect in May. Facebook said last week that it closed the loophole, but 90 million users were forcefully logged out of their accounts as a precaution. Irish regulators are investigating because Facebook's international headquarters is in Dublin. There are still many unanswered questions about the hack: Who carried it out?

At the same time, corporate rate cuts are made permanent under the bill. By 2027 a large majority of people making less than $200,000 will either see little change in their tax bill or a tax increase.","Tax moves to make before 2018   First, the good news. A lot of households under the  GOP tax plan , which President Trump is set to sign into law this week, will see a lower tax bill in the next several years. The nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation estimates that in 2019, more than half of filers making $40,000 and up will see an average tax cut greater than $500. That trend holds for income groups over $50,000    The Tax Institute at H&R Block provided some scenarios of people with young children, for instance, who could see their  tax burden drop  by roughly $2,000    But here's the thing: After 2025, all individual tax cuts are set to expire. At the same time, corporate rate cuts are made permanent under the bill. As a result, by 2027 a large majority of people making less than $200,000 will either see little change in their tax bill or a tax increase relative to what they pay today, the JCT estimates. Related: Try the CNN tax calculator to see how you may fare under GOP bill       Republicans made individual tax cuts temporary so they could meet budget rules that let them pass their tax overhaul with no Democratic votes. But don't worry, they say. A future Congress won't let middle class tax cuts expire. Recent precedents -- like the oft-extended Bush tax cuts -- suggest they may be right. Still, there's zero guarantee of that. After all, a lot can change over eight years. In any case, there's another reason you could end up with a tax increase after 2025. While the cuts are temporary, the GOP tax bill makes permanent another key provision that tax expert Lily Batchelder has described as a ""stealth tax increase"" for individuals, the effects of which will grow over time. The money it will raise is a big reason why the cost of the permanent corporate tax cuts will be paid for in the second decade, according to Batchelder, a tax law professor at New York University. Related: What's in the final GOP tax plan      The GOP plan introduces a new, slower inflation measure called chained CPI that will apply to inflation-adjusted parts of the tax code. So, for example, the income ranges that apply to each of the seven income tax rates will grow more slowly. So will the value of many tax credits and the income phaseout thresholds for various tax breaks. Those thresholds dictate whether you make too much money to qualify for certain breaks. The upshot for tax filers is this: Many tax breaks, Batchelder said,    CNNMoney (New York)    First published December 20, 2017: 4:54 PM ET",2017-12-20 21:54:29,"[0.010439324167605811, 0.9938262704928208, 0.01374391987742491, 0.003692858786013982, 0.07470488258434359, 0.0021785966377570504, 0.05759227402868978, 0.00559477331409478, 0.040261867381406476, 0.012437473033845894, 0.008209221823572052, 0.003222105587130837, 0.03317649359529246, 0.010484896423613691]",,Enjoy-your-tax-cuts-while-they-last.wav

Plus, some individuals will end up paying even more. The Tax Institute at H&R Block ran a number of scenarios for filers in different situations to give a more specific gauge of where you might stand in 2018 if you're a wage earner.

Much more needs to be unpacked by experts as to how that will play out for different filers. Nor do they take into account the potential effects of other provisions in the tax bill -- such as  eliminating the penalty for not buying health insurance  -- or any future spending cuts that may be made to help offset the cost of the tax bill.

Lee Carter, 52 — also known as Viper — was formally charged Thursday after Houston police responded to his home last year on a report of a kidnapping, according to a complaint obtained by HuffPost. Google Maps Advertisement The woman told police that she was abducted about four or five years prior while pregnant and panhandling on the street. The woman told officers that she was “vulnerable” and, “against her better judgement,” When the woman arrived at Carter’s home, she was allegedly locked inside his garage. After that point, Carter repeatedly forced her to do drugs and have sex with him, only feeding her “chips and snacks,” police said. The woman told officers that she never saw anyone inside Carter’s home but would sometimes overhear him fighting with other women. She would occasionally beg Carter to let her leave and made many failed attempts to get out, the complaint said.

Inside the garage, fire officials found a makeshift toilet that did not flush and a mattress covered with fresh vomit, according to the complaint.

The neighbor said that Carter described the women as “ungrateful” because they “want more food and drugs.” As Viper, Carter is perhaps most well known for the 2008 album “You’ll Cowards Don’t Even Smoke Crack.” Uploads of his music have received millions of views on YouTube.

Many victims are still fighting to have their convictions overturned or to secure full compensation. Justice Secretary Alex Chalk is looking at whether all those convicted could be exonerated or the Post Office could be stripped of its role.","1 hour ago About sharing Watch: Sunak says Post Office scandal is ""appalling miscarriage of justice"" By Dearbail Jordan Business reporter Measures are being considered by the government to clear the names of hundreds of sub-postmasters convicted in the Post Office Horizon scandal. More than 700 branch managers were convicted of false accounting, theft and fraud based on faulty software. But one option now would be for the Crown Prosecution Service and its own lawyers to step in as appeals continue to be heard. Many victims of the scandal - which began in 1999 - are still fighting to have their convictions overturned or to secure full compensation after being forced to pay out thousands of pounds of their own money for shortfalls that were caused by Horizon accounting software. In some cases it has opposed attempts by sub-postmasters to clear their names. Asked by Laura Kuenssberg if the Justice Secretary Alex Chalk was looking at whether all those convicted could be exonerated or the Post Office could be stripped of its role, Mr Sunak said: ""Obviously, there's legal complexity in all of those things but he is looking at exactly those areas that you've described. ""It is right that we find every which way we can do to try to make this right for the people who were so wrongfully treated at the time."" Last month, a board overseeing compensation called for all Post Office staff wrongly accused of theft and false accounting to have their convictions overturned. But Sir Bob Neill, chair of the Justice Select Committee, suggested such a move could require extra resources and have a knock-on effect on other cases. To do that I think you'd probably need extra resources. The Ministry of Justice  said last month  that it wanted the criminal appeals system to be as efficient and effective as possible, adding that it had asked the Law Commission to examine whether reforms were needed, and was waiting for that review to be concluded. Mr Castleton said that people were being""traumatised"" by both the appeals process and the battle to secure compensation, describing it as a ""war"". ""I would love it to be taken out of the hands of the people that really caused it in a way,"" he said. Potential offences could relate to ""monies recovered from sub-postmasters as a result of prosecutions or civil actions"", it said. ITV's Mr Bates vs the Post Office drama - a scene from which is seen here - has led to renewed anger over the scandal Between 1999 and 2015 more than 700 sub-postmasters were prosecuted and convicted based on information from the Horizon accounting system which made it look like money was missing. Some sub-postmasters wrongfully went to prison, many were financially ruined and forced to declare bankruptcy, while others describe being shunned by their communities following convictions for false accounting and theft. Some 54 cases have resulted in convictions being upheld, people being refused permission to appeal, or people withdrawing from the process, according to the Post Office. It centres on the story of sub-postmaster Alan Bates, played by actor Toby Jones, who led and won a legal battle, paving the way for dozens of convictions to be overturned. But Lord Arbuthnot said: ""There are so many people who behaved so very badly that I think it is probably wrong to focus on one person. ""At the moment, scores of people have got away with things which they should not have got away with and I hope they will not as a result of the public inquiry run by Sir Wyn Williams.""",2024-01-07 15:13:38,"[0.008916521427029464, 0.9912927843531374, 0.010743185441816362, 0.0049789362192393044, 0.03308427218456084, 0.0019551830678064073, 0.04895475415341987, 0.004960542180553897, 0.01818371523884473, 0.007349994616211397, 0.0073820989065221465, 0.0023876967506598784, 0.11438465753998639, 0.008403717906462974]",,Sunak-considers-ways-to-clear-all-victims-of-Post-Office-scandal.wav

Prince Andrew has always strongly denied any wrongdoing. Virginia Giuffre settled a civil case against Prince Andrew in the US in 2022. Polling firm YouGov has shown him to be consistently the least popular royal.,"27 minutes ago About sharing By Sean Coughlan Royal correspondent For Prince Andrew, it's been a terrible 2024 so far. But a few days later he was appearing in the much harsher light of US court documents about sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. But if anything he now seems further away than ever from any prospect of rehabilitation and a return to public life. This week Prince Andrew faced a wall of hostile newspaper front pages calling for his removal from royal life. Virginia Giuffre settled a civil case against Prince Andrew in the US in 2022 None of this is a good look for the wider Royal Family and will make any future public appearances with Prince Andrew even more difficult. ""There is no doubt that King Charles would have probably hoped for a better start going into 2024,"" says royal commentator Prof Pauline Maclaran. ""This is especially so because there have been rumours that he was feeling sorry for his brother and trying to rehabilitate him a little. If the rumours were true, I imagine King Charles may be seeing this latest news as quite a big setback,"" says Prof Maclaran of Royal Holloway, University of London. Also significant is the testimony of Johanna Sjoberg, who provides an independent witness to Prince Andrew being with Virginia Giuffre, who later sued and settled with Prince Andrew in a civil sex assault claim. It challenges Prince Andrew's assertion in his Newsnight interview that: ""I have no recollection of ever meeting this lady, none whatsoever."" The documents are from her legal battle with Virginia Giuffre Ghislaine Maxwell's testimony also shows that Prince Andrew had visited Epstein's private Caribbean island. That had been previously confirmed by the prince, but royal author Ed Owens says even though so far there are ""no major new allegations"", it still has a negative impact to see these repeated connections between Prince Andrew and Epstein. In terms of what comes next, expect more calls for Prince Andrew not to be treated differently from anyone else or to be seen as being above the law. But it's worth remembering that the court documents are not a ""list"" of people involved with Epstein. There are no suggestions that being mentioned implies any wrongdoing, with the names including a mix of business associates, victims, friends, employees and celebrity connections. ""You are refusing to answer the question,"" a lawyer says to Maxwell after a series of brittle exchanges about what she'd seen of Epstein being given sexual massages. The case was settled in 2017 without any of the allegations being tested in court, so these remain claims rather than findings, and Prince Andrew has always strongly denied any wrongdoing. Ms Giuffre's lawyer welcomed the latest court papers, but suggested more needed to be done for victims. Polling firm YouGov has shown him to be consistently the least popular royal, with the most recent figures showing only 8% of people in Britain have a favourable view of him.

In a statement, Koy said: ""I've stepped onto a lot of stages around the world in my career, but this one is going to be extra special.

Oppenheimer, starring (left to right) Emily Blunt, Cillian Murphy and Florence Pugh, is nominated for box office achievement Eight of the year's highest-earning, most acclaimed or most watched films are nominated in the new  cinematic and box office achievement  category. Taylor Swift is nominated for her concert film The Eras Tour. Mainstream films which don't generally show up during awards season are also recognised, with nominations for the latest John Wick, Mission: Impossible and Guardians of the Galaxy movies. The nominees are Ricky Gervais, Trevor Noah, Chris Rock, Amy Schumer, Sarah Silverman and Wanda Sykes.

Jodie Foster and Annette Bening are both nominated for their performances in Nyad The Golden Globes are traditionally a more light-hearted event than many of the other ceremonies in film awards season. Taking place in the first week of January, celebrity guests are usually in a good mood, fresh from their Christmas break, and ready to mingle over a few drinks.

The Labour leader said he and his wife, Victoria Starmer, have tried to keep their 15-year-old son and 13-year-old daughter out of the public eye. But he called for a general election ""as soon as possible"", saying that he wanted the fight. It comes after Rishi Sunak said it was his ""working assumption"" he would call one in the  second half of the year. Mr Starmer told  Sky News's Sunday Morning With Trevor Phillips  programme the ""country is ready"" to go to the ballot boxes. He also said he was committed to Labour's £28bn green investment plan, accusing the Tories of weaponising the issue. Speaking about a row over borrowing to invest in new energy technology and jobs, he said: ""If they want that fight, bring it on."" Mr Starmer was asked on the programme about how much support he owes to his family and wife. Mr Starmer said he talks through ""all the big decisions"" with his wife - but admitted he is concerned about the potential publicity around his two teenage children. He added: ""When I finished as chief prosecutor,  as director of public prosecutions  and was thinking about going into politics she was ringing other job adverts to go and carry on doing something in law. ""So, she didn't necessarily sign up to it, but she is absolutely centrally part of it. We've waited a long time for 2024, I am really glad this year is here. ""I want this fight, the only thing which keeps me up at night is our children because they are 13 and 15. ""Those are difficult ages - it will impact them. We don't name them in public. ""I am desperately trying to protect them in that way, but I know it is going to be hard and I do worry about that."" The PM appears to rule out holding a general election in the spring Mr Starmer also mocked the prime minister over his election date claiming Mr Sunak was putting ""vanity before country"". ""If he had a plan, he would set the date and he should set the date because at the moment it is very hard to see how him continuing in government improves the lives of anybody in the country, so there is drift,"" Mr Starmer said. ""And so my challenge to him would be: if you've got a plan, set the date.

He got too close to alpha male Mpungwe, who charged at him with a shriek. Despite being terrified, he knew the primate didn't want to hurt him. The aim of habituation is to save gorillas from extinction.","56 minutes ago About sharing Watch: Vianet Djenguet's scary encounter with gorilla Mpangwe By Lucy Wallis BBC News When a wildlife cameraman was invited to film the gradual exposure of a gorilla family to humans, deep in the forests of the Democratic Republic of Congo, he got a little too close for comfort to the group's alpha male. Suddenly, the giant silverback - known as Mpungwe - charged at him with a shriek. But, despite being terrified, Vianet Djenguet knew the almost 40-stone (254kg) primate didn't want to hurt him. ""But if you stand your ground, it stops him moving forward."" Mpungwe and his family are among the last remaining eastern lowland gorillas in DR Congo, and the ultimate aim of habituation is to save them from extinction. Over the course of time, he met other wild families and ""stole wild females"", says Mongane, until finally forming the family he has now. Adult males, such as Mpungwe, are called silverbacks after the distinctive silver hair on their backs But like any protective patriarch, Mpungwe, who is now 35 years old, will do anything to keep his group of 23 gorillas safe. He had to trek through dense forest each day, following the endangered gorillas with an eight stone (50kg) camera and tripod. Gorillas, who share about 98% of their DNA with humans, are just like us, he says. ""It just reminds me that we are so close to these creatures and they're doing incredible work for us,"" he says. ""They are the gardeners of those forests that release oxygen for us."" A female gorilla will breastfeed its baby until it is three years old, says chief guide, Mongane The female gorillas care in a similar way to human mothers, adds Djenguet. This low reproduction rate makes it harder for the gorillas to recover from population decline. And poacher's traps are still a deadly threat for the park's gorillas. Mpungwe's son lost his foot when he got it caught in a trap, says Mongane, but the animal sensed what he needed to do to survive. ""He got up very early in the morning and plunged his feet into the river, leaving them in there for at least 10 minutes,"" says Mongane. DR Congo lost 490,000 hectares (1.2m acres) of rainforest in 2020, according to Global Forest Watch. He says if there was enough money for conservation, the gorillas would not have to be part of eco-tourism. ""In that way, gorillas must pay for their own survival,"" he adds. If he ever returned, Djenguet believes Mpungwe will remember him.",2024-01-07 00:04:31,"[0.004710670612045902, 0.0037883549906644956, 0.003943229906484786, 0.0018514770623774303, 0.003125788003071365, 0.00129791449195402, 0.9993540547187496, 0.0015232655063848225, 0.0044103699118463536, 0.002096971407275536, 0.034299716326551155, 0.0024925924719826167, 0.0033792589391838284, 0.0020560073032146885]",,Earning-the-trust-of-a-40-stone-silverback-gorilla.wav

Here Are 8 Secrets About My Job You Should Know.,"Survey: Santa is, on average, 66 years old and most likely to grow his own beard for the job. Santas are diverse, and there’s a high demand for them. Some Santas get paid between $8,000 and $10,000 in a holiday season.","And we try to do what we can,” Connaghan said, noting that he’ll try to fulfill every photo request he gets on the street. The job comes with a unique set of skills, qualifications and uniform. According to Connaghan’s 2023  survey  of 380 people who have been Santas, Santa is, on average, 66 years old and most likely to grow his own beard for the job. “You represent something magical, something of a spirit almost where people like to say, ‘Wow,’” said Adrian Walker, who is a Santa based in the Atlanta metro area. “I always tell people, it’s not about believing in Santa as much as it is believing in the possibility of joy and love and just humanity ― just the good that exists.” HuffPost talked with four Santas about the secrets of their profession, from their biggest tips to what keeps them coming back year after year:  Advertisement 1. If we can make a child believe one more year, the parents are so happy. Some do get paid a lot — but there are upfront costs too. Walker said he gets paid between $8,000 and $10,000 in a holiday season. For Walker, those investments are worth it because of the magic they help create. For example, Sinclair is the president of a group on  Facebook  called  Santas of Color Coalition  and he said they offer monthly Zoom trainings on topics like beard maintenance, how to be a storyteller and how to be on social media. Connaghan said the most common challenging question children will ask him is “Can you fix it? Can you get Mom and Dad back together?”  Connaghan said in these situations, he acknowledges what the child is saying but does not make promises about whether he can fix anything. Santas are diverse, and there’s a high demand for them. When Sinclair was working as a mall Santa years ago, he recalled a mother who turned her family away when she saw he was the Santa for that afternoon. Let’s go.’ ... And she pulled the kids, walking away,” he said. “That probably still happens more times than not.“ But the demand for diverse Santas is high. Sinclair said the Santas of Color Coalition has grown to over 200 members in at least 19 states. Ultimately, Santa is a beloved icon that working Santas are proud to embody. “Most folks know me, they just say ‘Black Santa.’ I usually don’t get called anything else,” he said. “Even the kids in church call me ‘Black Santa.’” Rigor, who is Filipino, said Santa is a universal figure and at the same time, it can be even more meaningful for folks to see “that there’s one that’s from my culture or from my people.”  Do you have info to share with HuffPost reporters?",2023-12-14 10:45:30,"[0.04410510884628733, 0.7095712449478564, 0.01858493244969546, 0.05921834987494428, 0.06401590587797705, 0.020609061431760032, 0.011685436567251583, 0.13808509913623432, 0.17367381391185113, 0.574321347969028, 0.007568459526441415, 0.01034794514182025, 0.11074565335352195, 0.3074862529194092]",,Im-A-Santa-Here-Are-8-Secrets-About-My-Job-You-Should-Know.wav

But where he had proved himself adept was in reading and manipulating the emotional flow of a game. But it worked because Solskjær understood that PSG were scarred by failure and prone to collapsing under pressure, while his United side, at that point, had utter faith in him as a conduit of the comeback spirit of 1999. They would wait and go when he told them, and do so with a greater ferocity and belief in that final quarter-hour than they could have managed over the full 45 minutes, when each thwarted attack might have dented self-confidence, when a successful counter might have doubled their task.

When optimising your brand, it’s important to remain open-minded towards other industries such as football, entertainment, music, etc. Simply because sport is a global entertainment business that has many audiences that crossover from different demographics For that reason, there are plenty of insights we can learn from England football regarding how they’ve optimised their TikTok marketing methods to meet the needs and wants of the algorithm If we pay meticulous attention to detail to how their highlight grid looks, it’s got the TikTok customised thumbnails for the majority of their content alongside pictures of their sponsors and the colours of their kit, which straight away establishes a brand identity for anyone visiting their profile Therefore, when it comes towards utilising branded content across channels such as Instagram or TikTok, which have very similar formats, ensure that you use consistent colour codes and features to meet the needs and wants of their algorithms to ensure your content gets ranked as highly as possible to reach the audiences you desire Stephen ‘Wonderboy’ Thompson demonstrates how repurposing advocational content can work in your favour YouTube video uploaded by Stephen ‘Wonderboy’ Thompson Following an extravagant event last weekend at #UFC294, many athletes have shared their opinions/views/thoughts about Islam Mackhachev’s astonishing finish on Alexander Volkanovski The finish was a crosskick to Volk’s temple, which will be a highlight reel for Islam for the remainder of his career. Now Wonderboy has capitalised on this through his YouTube channel by analysing the move alongside doing his usual breakdowns of karate tutorials and kickboxing tutorials from an educational standpoint, as that is the core theme of his YouTube channel If you’re an upcoming fighter, it’s certainly worth paying attention to big events and focusing on adapting your niche to promote your brand in a fashion that remains authentic to your values That’s enough from me, is there anything that I’ve missed out on?

Expect to see AI everywhere next week: in cars, scooters, headphones, cameras, speakers, televisions, and handheld devices. Intel, Qualcomm, and AMD are expected to announce chips that support AI services on the devices that carry them.","If you're waiting  for the hubbub over generative  AI  to die down, maybe pull up a chair. The buzz around artificial intelligence shows no signs of quieting—a fact that will become all too obvious at this year’s CES. CES, the consumer electronics industry’s largest annual gathering in the US, is returning to Las Vegas on January 9. It is a massive, four-day-long bustling bazaar of tech, with expo halls filled to the brim with new gadgets, hopeful startups, and prototypes that reach for the stars. CES is a trade show where sales and distribution deals are inked, where concept cars roll through crowded streets, and where tech journalists and showgoers alike wander the floors looking for the standout new products. And this year, many of the products debuting are going to be garnished with heaping globs of AI. For years, generative AI technology bubbled beneath the surface of public consciousness. It finally burst into the limelight  in November 2022 , when OpenAI released the first iteration of  ChaptGPT . Since the reverberant waves of this eruption hadn't yet fully saturated the tech industry by the time last year's CES took place, there wasn't really a whole lot of GenAI talk in Las Vegas last January. As a result, CES 2023 looks almost primitive in hindsight, arriving a scant six weeks behind the greatest technological revolution since the mobile phone. That won’t be the case in 2024. “We didn’t get the full CES fire hose of AI announcements last year like we’re going to have,” says Anshel Sag, a principal analyst at Moor Insights & Strategy. “If you thought it was a wave last year, it's going to be a tsunami this year.” Expect to see AI everywhere next week at CES: in cars, scooters, headphones, cameras, speakers, televisions, and handheld devices. In some cases, these products will simply include another way to access a ChatGPT-style question-and-response service to handle spoken commands. But in other cases, the advances could feel more impactful. Companies like Intel, Qualcomm, and AMD are expected to announce chips that support AI services on the devices that carry them. These chips would process AI tasks locally, without having to send a request to a server in the cloud and then wait for a response, making things like computer vision, voice-to-text services, and generative computing feel snappier. Sag says that’s what’s likely to happen with the abundance of AI this CES. “AI is just going to overwhelm everything,” Sag says. “It will be so prevalent and so dominant that some people will just be sick of it.”",2024-01-06 12:00:00,"[0.006302471482640181, 0.09324640791359635, 0.004446682530532533, 0.005057064119806668, 0.005355802293765456, 0.004441320915936181, 0.00541936129373958, 0.002515789663231288, 0.0074007903836422325, 0.002946632722395187, 0.004146771928149559, 0.0018515284714132117, 0.9954973450406926, 0.006073595010945844]",,CES-2024-Preview-Get-Ready-for-a-Tsunami-of-AI.wav

Imagine if AI can reliably generate a compelling legal brief, with total accuracy in locating precedents. Lawyers will submit these without bothering to look at them, confident that they are relevant. And there will be very little work to do for actual lawyers. Heck, ChatGPT-4 can already  pass the bar exam ! The same applies for other fields that demand accuracy, which is pretty much every human profession. Because we can’t trust LLMs, there’s still work for humans to do. Hallucinations are kind of a firewall between us and massive unemployment. Will that day ever come when we get rid of hallucinations? “The answer in a broad sense is no,” says Vempala, whose paper was called “Calibrated Models Must Hallucinate.” Ahmad, on the other hand, thinks that we can do it. “There's a red-hot focus in the research community right now on the problem of hallucination, and it's being tackled from all kinds of angles,” he says. But I shudder to think of how much we humans will miss if given a free pass to skip over the sources of information that make us truly knowledgeable. And I will mourn the countless jobs lost when we turn over the bulk of white-collar work to robots. For now, though, AI can’t be trusted. Time Travel I’ve been writing about artificial intelligence for at least 40 years—I dealt with it in my first book,  Hackers —but can make a special claim to a degree of prescience for an essay leading off a WIRED special section about AI in 2010. It was called “ The AI Revolution Is On.”  (I’ve included portions of this in some other episodes of Time Travel but suspect my human readers have probably forgotten, though ChatGPT probably has not.) What sounded science fiction-y then is now reality. And yet, because the bots' behavior isn't based on human thought processes, we are often powerless to explain their actions. It also seems to display how those answers are derived.

Do you expect to see that humanoid workforce growing in the coming years? Warehouse work is one of the great applications at the moment because there's such a need for people. You can organize the environment, but then that’s less interesting for people like us who want to, you know, make the real future happen. One group is working on robots that repair bicycles. The dream is to be able to fix any bicycle, which isn't as hard as fixing a car, but it's also not just stacking boxes. There’s a bicycle out there in the lab, and the robot is doing some stuff, but it’s early days. Another thing we're doing is building an ultra-mobile two-wheeled vehicle—a bicycle with a jumping and bouncing mechanism on it. When you look at the world of robotics, this might be a biased opinion, but I feel that locomotion and mobility has come a long way, but manipulation has a much longer way to go, even though we've been working on it for 50 years. People sometimes feel creeped out by the robots you’ve built. Do you think that could get worse now that systems like ChatGPT have prompted more discussion around  AI potentially becoming dangerous ? Most bad things that happen in the world aren’t coming from robots. And the question I have is, are people really afraid of robots? My experience of going around with Spot is that people love to engage with it, they love to have selfies with it, and they will pet the robot. Even in individuals, depending on how you pose the question, you could get people saying, “Yeah, I’m afraid of that robot but not afraid of this other robot.” I’d just like to know what the real story is. Are you at all worried that the leaps we’ve seen in AI could bring new risks? I'm a little surprised that Musk and Sam Altman are so out there saying we need to be careful.

The character is entering the public domain because of Disney's efforts to protect it. Some of the Steamboat Willie images are explicit middle-fingers to Disney.,"As anything related to  AI artwork  tends to stir up controversy, he’s been pleasantly surprised by the joyful reception his tool has received online; because it is built on a tiny set of low-quality images, the works it creates tend toward the rough-hewn and glitchy. (“You should not expect consistently good results from Mickey-1928,” his project description warns.) Langlais originally intended to add to the data set to improve its quality, but now he’s going to leave it as is. “I think people liked that it was slightly bad,” he says. “It created some funny results.” Others liked it precisely because of its political valence. “It’s pretty satirical,” says emerging technology researcher Eryk Salvaggio. The Steamboat Willie iteration of Mickey Mouse entering the public domain is a big deal partly because people love all things Disney, but also because Disney played a role in shaping contemporary copyright protections specifically to shield this character. As Salvaggio points out, people nicknamed the Copyright Term Extension Act of 1998—which, as its name suggests, extended copyright terms—as the “Mickey Mouse Protection Act,” because Disney lobbied aggressively in favor of  prolonging copyright . “This particular Mickey Mouse, from  Steamboat Willie , is now in the public domain at a time when questions about what we can grab and use are up for debate,” Salvaggio says. “It’s an interesting confluence.” At least some of the AI-generated Steamboat Willie images are explicit middle-fingers to Disney. On the social network Bluesky, for example, a user called Virtual Balboa posted an  image of Willie smoking a joint . (They asked to be identified by their pseudonym so their family “doesn't get swatted by some random lunatic.”) In an email, they detailed their motivations for creating doobie-smoking Willie. “I love the idea that Disney will be forced to spend money and resources looking at my stupid pictures to check if they are too far removed from  Steamboat Willie  to count as public domain,” they wrote. While people like Langlais and Neville are experimenting with Steamboat Willie in part to test the guardrails put in place by generative AI companies, Virtual Balboa is deeply skeptical that enhanced copyright protections will benefit regular people: “Any guardrail-type laws will be written by computer-illiterate geriatrics and only make life harder for people trying to use ‘ethical AI’ to do legitimate work.” Putting aside considerations of how digitally savvy regulators may or may not be, the rush to remix Steamboat Willie with AI tools demonstrates, once again, the growing inescapability of these products.",2024-01-02 23:25:43,"[0.07996560469713265, 0.08181680288830105, 0.010452704628048806, 0.0053065348835941144, 0.010717205862915333, 0.016340758911693634, 0.009507384823048637, 0.004371030834658103, 0.008566474491755696, 0.00446228805837455, 0.006260245604868639, 0.002710858191854022, 0.9929932484601849, 0.010358179829668055]",,Sex-Drugs-and-AI-Mickey-Mouse.wav

Researchers from Columbia University recently described a similar phenomenon in neurons. The authors surmised that chronic low-level inflammation in the brain may keep infections under control.","“The cell is effectively dressing up as an infectious agent,” Kagan said. “The result is that it convinces itself that it’s infected, and then operates as such.” Simmering Immunity Immune responses can be destructive, and antiviral responses especially so. Because viruses are at their most dangerous when they’re already inside a cell, most immune strategies that target viral infections work in part by damaging and killing infected cells. For that reason, cells cry “Virus!” at their own risk. In most tissues, Alu sequences are highly suppressed so that they never get a chance to mimic a viral attack. How does it balance the health of the growing embryo with a potentially risky immune response? In experiments with mice, Totary-Jain’s team found that the placenta’s double-stranded RNAs and ensuing immune response didn’t seem to hurt the developing embryos. Instead they protected the embryos from Zika virus infection. Typically the first responders to double-stranded Alu RNA escapees are type I and type II interferons, which quickly recruit destructive immune cells to the site of an infection, leading to tissue damage and even autoimmune disease. It acts locally by communicating only with cells within the tissue, generating a milder immune response—one that can be sustained long term in the placenta. How placental cells manage to activate only interferon lambda, keeping the immune response simmering but never boiling over, is still a mystery. But Totary-Jain has an idea about why placental cells evolved this trick that other cells seemingly avoid: Since the placenta is discarded at birth, perhaps it can afford to take immune risks that other tissues can’t. However, this trick—a low-level immune response generated by a fake virus—may not be limited to the placenta. Researchers from Columbia University recently described a similar phenomenon in neurons. They observed RNAs from different genomic elements  bound together  in double strands to produce an immune response. In this instance, the immune system called in a more destructive type I interferon, but it was produced at low levels. The authors surmised that chronic low-level inflammation in the brain may keep infections under control, preventing major inflammation and neuronal death. It’s possible, then, that this kind of immune trickery is more common than anyone thought. By studying how the immune system seems to break its own rules, scientists can better define what the rules are in the first place.

She hoped these measurements could help her predict the poorly understood energy demands that cold environments place on human bodies. But in other cases, people were losing a lot of muscle mass and coming back feeling horrible,” she says. So after Wyoming, Ocobock began a project with reindeer herders in Finland that include the Sámi, an Indigenous group. Worth the wait, she felt, since scientists still knew little about how bodies respond to extreme cold. “A lot of things were left over from the 1930s, and even older.” Most Popular Security 23andMe Blames Users for Recent Data Breach as It's Hit With Dozens of Lawsuits Lily Hay Newman Gear The 18 Best Games on PlayStation Plus Reece Rogers Gear Pick the Philips Wired Camera if You Love Hue Simon Hill Gear 10 Great Deals on Laptops, Routers, and Apple Watch Scott Gilbertson Historical research had provided cold physiology with three guiding principles relevant to many warm-blooded animals: Bergmann’s rule, Allen’s rule, and Thomson’s rule. Thirty years after Bergmann, American ornithologist Joel Asaph Allen tacked “shorter appendages” onto the theory of larger bodies. Our bodies make their own vitamin D out of a precursor chemical, 7-dehydrocholesterol, that absorbs UV-B rays from sunlight. Near the equator, there’s enough strong sun for people to get their vitamin D supply. In fact, the risk is  too much  cancer-causing sunlight, so people have more melanin, a skin pigment that absorbs UV. But as frigid climates get less sun, melanin competes with 7-dehydrocholesterol for weaker sunlight, so the body risks underproducing vitamin D. Experts believe this prompted ancient humans who lived in northern latitudes to develop lighter skin tones,  which synthesize vitamin D faster , an adaptation to life far from the equator. That same hair sample also showed genetic signs of high body-mass index, which is another adaptation to cold. Last year, Ocobock reported that brown fat speeds up the metabolisms of Finnish reindeer herders by  about 9 percent  when they feel cold.

That means brown fat may also play an  indirect  role for heating, such as releasing fuel or signaling molecules to other organs. Ocobock’s strangest discovery while observing Finnish and Sámi herders involved the calories they burn at rest. Ocobock figured that the cold climate would give every inhabitant a higher resting metabolism, compared to people living in warm climates. “The lowered resting metabolic rates among males might be an  embodiment  of climate change,” she says. For one thing, humans only migrated to colder climates less than 100,000 years ago—a blink in evolutionary timescales.",2024-01-06 12:00:00,"[0.009558007565070447, 0.05541029559066374, 0.008732015720146492, 0.0064470206112860785, 0.006076467091528148, 0.009035879109141423, 0.015226218292716868, 0.003273882913226337, 0.009324093560507968, 0.0041497071163223076, 0.02038488450141857, 0.002766068914308193, 0.9978872747542828, 0.007282740174195248]",,How-Your-Body-Adapts-to-Extreme-Cold.wav

Different stretches have different geology and topography, and different rates of groundwater extraction. Virginia Beach, where 451,000 people and 177,000 properties are at risk.","Below is New York’s JFK Airport—notice the red hotspots of high subsidence against the teal of more mild elevation change. The airport’s average subsidence rate is 1.7 millimeters a year (similar to the LaGuardia and Newark airports), but across JFK that varies between 0.8 and 2.8 millimeters a year, depending on the exact spot. Courtesy of Leonard O Ohenhen This sort of differential subsidence can also bork much smaller structures, like buildings, where one side might drop faster than another. “Even if that is just a few millimeters per year, you can potentially cause cracks along structures,” says Ohenhen. The study finds that subsidence is highly variable along the Atlantic Coast, both regionally and locally, as different stretches have different geology and topography, and different rates of groundwater extraction. It’s looking particularly problematic for several communities, like Virginia Beach, where 451,000 people and 177,000 properties are at risk. In Baltimore, Maryland, it’s 826,000 people and 335,000 properties, while in NYC—in Queens, Bronx, and Nassau—that leaps to 5 million people and 1.8 million properties. So there’s two components to addressing the problem of subsidence: Getting high-resolution data like in this study, and then pairing that with groundwater data. “Subsidence is so spatially variable,” says Snider. “Having the details of where groundwater extraction is really having an impact, and being able to then demonstrate that we need to change our management of that water, that reduces subsidence in the future.” The time to act is now, Shirzaei emphasizes. Facing down subsidence is like treating a disease: You spend less money by diagnosing and treating the problem now, saving money later by avoiding disaster. “This kind of data and the study could be an essential component of the health care system for infrastructure management,” he says. “Like cancers—if you diagnose it early on, it can be curable. But if you are late, you invest a lot of money, and the outcome is uncertain.”",2024-01-05 12:00:00,"[0.013470933729854749, 0.08349264286939927, 0.016138488813088023, 0.012059151046566508, 0.017959092285157578, 0.004698175447793201, 0.7564595898633842, 0.00867061857498267, 0.040263531918563605, 0.00839043358953353, 0.6449869263216443, 0.009722172969899915, 0.04370700457353623, 0.009286367143817855]",,Critical-Infrastructure-Is-Sinking-Along-the-US-East-Coast.wav

He was quickly diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder. He tried talk therapy and a range of medications, but they didn’t help. “I was fighting a war in my head,” he says. Eventually, he learned about Veterans Exploring Treatment Solutions, a Texas-based organization helping service members access psychedelic treatments in countries where such drugs are legal or unregulated. In 2022, the group paid for him to fly to Mexico to be part of a  study sponsored by Stanford University  testing a psychoactive drug called ibogaine. Derived from the root bark of the African iboga shrub, ibogaine has been used for centuries by the Pygmy tribes in Central Africa in spiritual and healing ceremonies. It is illegal in the US and many other places. Hudak was one of 30 special operations veterans with traumatic brain injuries and severe psychiatric symptoms who took an oral dose of the drug. After treatment with ibogaine, they experienced an average reduction of 88 percent in PTSD symptoms, 87 percent in depression symptoms, and 81 percent in anxiety symptoms. The effects lasted for at least a month, when the study period ended. “I had all these voices in my head that would yell at me and shame me,” Hudak says. “What ibogaine did was cut out those extraneous voices.” He suddenly had more life, more energy. He could be present for his 7-year-old son. A friend from high school remarked that Hudak seemed like his old self again. Veterans are already at a high risk of developing psychiatric conditions because of their combat experiences, and physical trauma to the head, such as from blast explosions, can compound that risk. Antidepressants and antianxiety medications are commonly prescribed, but they don’t address the underlying brain injury. Their mental illness was so disabling that it interfered with their cognition, mobility, self-care, and daily activities. Like Hudak, they had previously tried multiple treatments.

NBCU Photo Bank/NBCUniversal via Getty Images Only 219 jokes on Colbert were directed at the left and 18 at non-partisan figures. The Late Night show host made fun of both Trump (385) and former Rep. George Santos (262) more than twice as much as Biden (119), with Harris again only receiving one joke made at her expense. Meyers’ NBC show was in third place with 84% of the political jokes being anti-conservative (2,050 out of 2,445 jokes). And of the top 10 political people Meyers roasted this year, nine of them were conservative – including Trump, Rudy Giuliani, and Gov. Ron DeSantis, R-Fla., with Biden being the only leftist in that set. Seth Meyers’ NBC show was in third place with 84% of the political jokes being anti-conservative. Less than a quarter of the jokes were anti-leftist, at 231. As for the variety of “Daily Show” guest hosts, MRC calculated the most anti-conservative was actor and liberal activist John Leguizamo. Leguizamo told 66 political jokes during his time hosting the show, with 65 of them slamming right-wing subjects. The host told 1,416 political jokes, with 929 of them slamming conservatives (66%). Fallon had a more even split than his late-night colleagues when it came to mocking conservative figures. James Corden’s show also targeted conservatives with its jokes. The watchdog’s study stated, “Fallon poked fun at 196 unique targets, 103 of whom were on the right, 85 of whom were on the left, and 18 of whom were non-partisan.” James Corden’s CBS show, which only lasted four months into the year, rounded out the list, with 134 political jokes out of 245 aimed at conservatives (54%).",2024-01-06 14:07:48,"[0.018722011431187895, 0.012353871602729277, 0.8345037496367735, 0.003770733941814921, 0.0055576513090488605, 0.04511733593846952, 0.005572326131030554, 0.543923631605667, 0.0679867554752877, 0.008991688317829203, 0.004181752461017055, 0.008843331969046452, 0.006867710511104865, 0.017023684200181993]",,Watchdog-finds-81-of-all-political-late-night-show-jokes-in-2023-targeted-conservatives.wav

Print     As global carbon emissions from human activity hit an  all-time high  last year, my family zeroed out emissions from our home and cars while getting an 11% tax-free return on the investment. I spent my career in the Department of Energy’s  National Laboratory system  researching how to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions. I know that a  third  of U.S. energy-related emissions come from homes and personal vehicles. Since our property is shaded by grand, carbon-storing redwoods, on-site solar wasn’t an option. Quite the contrary: Our energy bills for home and cars fell by about $11,000 per year. Although ample off-the-shelf technology existed, decidedly human challenges stymied our use of them. Window vendors made recommendations that would have seriously undercut our energy savings. After reporting lower-than-advertised driving range in our first electric vehicle, I was ghosted by customer support, later learning that I may have been among the thousands shunted to a secret “ diversion team ” to deflect such complaints. The math isn’t always straightforward, so consumers could use some guidance. Sadly, I didn’t encounter a single tradesperson who offered these calculations. Most were skeptical, ignoring juicy rebates and tax credits; sometimes their errors or lack of skill increased project costs. So, I crunched the numbers and found that our package of improvements would pay back in  nine years, a return that could motivate many homeowners and help sellers close deals. Thanks to such factors, alongside incentives under President Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act, it would actually have cost more to install a conventional gas furnace and water heater than the high-performance and climate-friendly electric heat pump system that does both jobs. After incentives, our EV purchase costs were  on par  with those of comparable gas cars. Thanks to the lower rates, our home’s total electricity bills didn’t go up at all. As the visionary physicist Amory Lovins has long  said , energy efficiency is not only a free lunch, but one you’re paid to eat. Eliminating our 27-ton annual carbon-dioxide footprint — equal to the yearly  emissions  of around 15 high-performing  hybrid cars  — is another welcome return on investment. Fortunately, the  U.S. government  and  NGOs  are stepping up green workforce development, a pressing need if our nation is to meet decarbonization targets. If consumers don’t literally take control of their power, and policymakers, product manufacturers and the trades don’t make it easier for them to do so, climate change could indeed send us back into caves.",2024-01-06 11:00:36,"[0.006952115183120894, 0.9815809886709476, 0.008180066954247648, 0.005766920971815533, 0.024758336810614418, 0.0023946537501733133, 0.127492785343217, 0.007079575571057631, 0.10234675311020151, 0.011134294003116494, 0.019657176127418866, 0.0040256120826292876, 0.090798949701397, 0.013458447917804497]",,Opinion-Greening-our-Northern-California-home-and-cars-cut-our-energy-bills-by-11000-a-year-But-it-wasnt-easy.wav

Oceanographers have now discovered what appears to be a massive dumping ground of military weaponry. “Who knew that right in our backyard, the more you look, the more you find.”        Scripps researchers were able to group most of the military waste that they found underwater into four general categories: munition boxes, smoke floats, and two types of WWII-era depth charges. (UC San Diego Scripps Institution of Oceanography)   Among the munitions documented were Hedgehog and Mark 9 depth charges — explosives that were typically dropped from warships to attack submarines. Researchers also identified Mark 1 smoke floats — chemical smoke munitions that were dropped by ships to mark locations or to conceal their movements. Advertisement   These findings, made public Friday, build on a stunning 2021  underwater sonar survey  that identified tens of thousands of barrel-like objects between Los Angeles and Catalina Island. Discarding military waste at sea was not uncommon in decades past, but this once-forgotten history of ocean dumping continues to haunt our environment today. Dozens of marine scientists and ecotoxicologists have since  convened regularly  to discuss the data gaps in our understanding of DDT, a pesticide (banned in 1972) that was largely manufactured in Los Angeles and was so powerful it poisoned birds and fish. Gavin Newsom also boosted further research with an additional  $5.6 million. “What’s scary — as if we needed it to be more scary — is that we’re now up to more than 100 square miles of contamination from this dumpsite, with high DDT concentrations at depths that nobody’s even ever looked before, and now we’re seeing all the other stuff that was dumped as well,” he said. “And it’s only what we see, from the standpoint of big munitions, as opposed to: How do we know there weren’t other chemicals that were dumped by the Department of Defense?” David Valentine, the UC Santa Barbara scientist whose marine research team  first came across  dozens of eerie-looking barrels, also emphasized that the less-visible pollution is more cause for concern. “Now that we know that the military had their thing going on, and that the chemical dumping was being bulk dumped, it really begs the question: So what else could have required being contained in these barrels?” he said. Advertisement   On the most recent expedition, a crew of nine Scripps researchers and  10 specialists from the Navy’s Supervisor of Salvage scanned the seafloor for more than 300 hours — capturing as many images as possible with high-resolution technology not typically available to scientists. Terrill, an oceanographer who also specializes in scouring the deep sea for downed military aircraft as a co-founder of the nonprofit  Project Recover , tapped  an underwater archaeologist  on his team to help identify the vintage military debris. Advanced sonar readings pinpointed potentially more than 60 whale falls, and researchers were able to visually confirm seven with their camera system. Many questions remain on why there appears to be such a high concentration of dead whales slowly decomposing off the coast of Southern California. Smith and his colleagues are eager to study this further. (UC San Diego Scripps Institution of Oceanography)     Advertisement   “When we do population-level calculations, we estimate there may be on the order of 600,000 or more whale falls in the global ocean. But they fall more or less randomly, so they’re hard to find,” said Smith, who noted that whale falls become fascinating yet elusive ecosystems for deep-sea critters. Her team was able to capture high-resolution images of different seafloor textures, for example, as well as mounds that might indicate small burrowing animals that could stir up any chemicals half-buried in the sediment.",2024-01-05 19:20:34,"[0.006412643413210926, 0.011180770421501014, 0.006660588324476284, 0.004135130480319858, 0.00431593960631896, 0.003895116358523481, 0.05618611379521563, 0.003326654932308597, 0.008174108675132805, 0.0033983996761583297, 0.9981845222721426, 0.004894867351052096, 0.00883006129175337, 0.0042455822076724525]",,Massive-dumping-ground-of-WWII-era-munitions-discovered-off-Los-Angeles-coast.wav

Forests have traditionally functioned as “carbon sinks,” writes Sharma. Three-quarters of global deforestation is driven by agriculture, he says.","Sharma   Jan. 5, 2024  3 AM PT    Share   Facebook   Twitter   LinkedIn   Email   Copy Link URL Copied! According to a recent  report  from the World Wildlife Fund, 6.6 million hectares of forest were lost in 2022. It’s a mind-boggling statistic, especially since  it represents  21% more forest cover than  should have been lost that year to keep pace  to end deforestation by 2030 — a  pledge from   the 2021 United Nations climate conference (COP26 )  in Glasgow, Scotland. At last year’s COP28 in Dubai,  world leaders renewed their pledge to reverse deforestation. Yet forests are still being cleared at a dizzying pace. In 2022, the world lost  more than 11 soccer fields  of tropical forest per minute. Environmental crises are for many people an abstraction, and so can seem their repercussions. Microbes can bring diseases to humans, and for that reason the World Health Organization has applied a philosophy to them called  One Health . That chain of events has been tied to  Ebola  flare-ups in Central and West Africa and the upswing of  Lyme  disease in the northeastern United States. And it harms animals too: In subtropical parts of Australia where  forests are blithely cleared , bats experience  profound stress  from human-induced land change. Access to the diet of their native habitats is taken away, and in a nutritionally deprived state, they are known to  shed greater amounts of the Hendra virus  — which can pass on to horses and then humans, with  high  fatality rates. Forests have traditionally functioned as “carbon sinks.” The Earth’s trees absorb  more than 7 billion  metric tons of carbon dioxide — about a fifth of what the  world lets out into its atmosphere  — and release it back as oxygen or bind it into sugars that form their roots, branches and leaves. Advertisement   Then there’s evidence showing the extent to which forests influence our mental health. By contrast,  research  has found that the more a country’s landmass is covered by forests, the lower its prevalence of mental health disorders. In the 1980s, Japan even pioneered a form of therapy around trees: s hinrin-yoku,  also known as “forest bathing,” which seeks to harness psychologically restorative effects from being outdoors. But researchers found that  subsidizing a local clinic  to make healthcare more affordable and accessible reduced this problem. Ultimately, however,  three-quarters  of global deforestation is driven by agriculture — a reality that calls for ambitious legislation. The European Union’s  regulation on deforestation-free supply chains  imposes trade embargoes on products such as palm oil, cattle and soy that are frequently produced on illegally deforested lands, and in the U.S., the  FOREST Act  is a bipartisan bill that would take a similar approach. Brazil has already shown some promise  in slowing the deforestation trend. What remains to be seen is if they’ll be able to see the forest from the trees and produce real change rather than an empty promise.",2024-01-05 11:00:16,"[0.007029249807026182, 0.026356600424349695, 0.006758490372594267, 0.005042753830901395, 0.006224185702807266, 0.0026018176146715933, 0.9747343934877233, 0.004312296650152942, 0.027105205367051903, 0.006269797330038877, 0.21907628747048444, 0.004599929891221259, 0.013327002768619632, 0.006810169151011602]",,Opinion-Why-disappearing-trees-are-so-bad-for-our-climate--and-health.wav

She says trauma creates fragments within the self that show themselves through manifestations of psychic disconnect. Emanuel: “You know there’s no ‘ It ,’” adult survivor Shauna says in alluding to The Wilderness.","When experiencing cognitive overload, viewers can rely on the shows they love—and know—without adding to their psychic plates. As a biblical studies scholar, I am trained to acknowledge the work of repetition. Even Jesus’ life is told in four different ways, and that’s just accounting for the canonized Gospels. While the biblical authors may have crafted similar stories independently of one another, many did not. Scribes copying sources for circulation also made changes as they wrote, even if minimal. I also emphasize the show’s second season, which was not yet released when Stoker wrote her piece. This essay also continues to engage the Bible because, well, it’s what I do. Team members who live beyond the forest have, to varying degrees, post-trauma effects of hypervigilance, flashbacks, nightmares, and dissociations. Their experiences of starvation and suffering resist coherent narrativization, another common effect of trauma, and are often expressed in the 2021 timeline through post-trauma reenactments such as skinning a backyard squirrel (Shauna), beheading the family dog (Taissa), or operating a stuck-in-the-past, 1990s themed video store (Van). At one point, we even asked friends to help us cast each of our dogs as a  Yellowjackets  character. While, at least from a scholarly perspective, there is no such thing as “one Bible” or “one biblical God” or “one biblical storyline”—multiple authors with differing ideologies wrote the stories within the Bible over hundreds of years (also likely with no foresight that their stories would become canonized)—there are shared themes that help tie the narratives together. And in Revelation, that messiah, now resurrected, burns those who disagree with him for all eternity. While much of these terrors lack historical reliability, they still reflect the pain and suffering experienced in antiquity. 130 CE, the emperor Hadrian founded a Roman city on top of Jerusalem’s ruins and forced local Jews into diaspora. Right: 16th c. depiction of Jesus’ final banquet by Joan de Joanes) More than ritual, however, trauma recovery focuses on stories. Because trauma creates fragments within the self—ones that show themselves through manifestations of psychic disconnect (e.g., hypervigilance, anxiety, flashbacks)—recovery requires building new connections. This is a process, to be sure, filled with reckoning, revision, challenging, and reality-checking. Through the processes of  introjection and association , we sympathize with their attempts to survive. “You know there’s no ‘ It ,’” adult survivor Shauna says in alluding to The Wilderness.

The  FBI ’s Tampa division said 24-year-old Jonathan Daniel Pollock, 33-year-old Olivia Michele Pollock and 27-year-old Joseph Daniel Hutchinson III were all apprehended Saturday in Groveland, Florida, west of Orlando. Olivia Pollock and Hutchinson were arrested and charged in June 2021 alongside two others, but they vanished while out on bond awaiting trial. The two others, Joshua Christopher Doolin and Michael Steven Perkins, were sentenced in August. Prosecutors say the five Floridians spent well over two hours attacking police who were trying to defend the Capitol building on Jan. 6, 2021. Jonathan Pollock, seen in photographs dressed head-to-toe in military-style tactical gear, is accused of leading a charge against law enforcement with a flagpole. Court documents say he screamed while trying to force his way up Capitol stairs: “Let’s go!” The Floridians allegedly used stolen riot shields, flagpoles and their bare hands to hit, punch and choke law enforcement. Olivia Pollock, who was also dressed in military-style gear, is accused of attempting to steal an officer’s baton. Advertisement One of the group could allegedly be heard in video footage of the incident yelling, “We didn’t come all this way just to stand here!”  Court documents state that Hutchinson had worked at a gun shop owned by the Pollack family in Lakeland, Florida; Jonathan and Olivia Pollack are believed to be siblings. Trump is now fighting efforts to bar him from ballots in certain states where his actions are considered insurrectionary.

In a complaint, officials argued that the company should be forced to offer reinstatement and back pay to Stephen Andrade. Andrade lost his job making store signs in June after a manager accused him of leaving a power saw in the back of the store after being told to remove it.","Prosecutors at the National Labor Relations Board say Trader Joe’s illegally fired a union supporter in Massachusetts because he was pushing for better working conditions. In a  complaint  filed Tuesday, officials argued that the company should be forced to offer reinstatement and back pay to Stephen Andrade, a nearly 18-year Trader Joe’s veteran in Massachusetts. Andrade lost his job making store signs in June after a manager accused him of leaving a power saw in the back of the store after being told to remove it. Advertisement Both Andrade and the union  previously told HuffPost  they believed his firing was retaliatory. The complaint says Trader Joe’s should have to send Andrade a letter “apologizing for any hardship or distress caused by his discharge.” In a phone interview, Andrade, 46, said he was pleased to see that prosecutors found merit in his story. “I hope that the union can keep chalking up some wins and we can hold the company accountable for their practices and trying to union-bust,” Andrade said. But I know that’s not how capitalism works these days.” The complaint also states that Trader Joe’s retaliated against union workers in Massachusetts and Minnesota by providing them with lesser 401(k) contributions than non-union workers. Officials say the move was intended to “discourage employees from engaging” in their protected rights. Trader Joe’s, which is based in Monrovia, California, did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Wednesday. Those earlier charges are all part of the new complaint that was issued Tuesday. Stephen Andrade, who worked nearly 18 years for Trader Joe's, was fired by the company in June. Courtesy Maeg Yosef Advertisement Andrade’s store in Hadley, Massachusetts, became the first Trader Joe’s store in the nation to  form a union  last July, by a vote of 45 to 31. The election win by Trader Joe’s United was followed by other victories in Minneapolis; Louisville, Kentucky; and Oakland, California, bringing the number of union stores so far to four. “This follows a continued pattern of you not taking direction,” the incident report alleged. “I’m prepared to stick it out for however long,” he said.

Advertisement Officials said Exclusive Poultry, which is based in La Puente, employed kids as young as 14 to “debone poultry using sharp knives” and to “operate power-driven lifts to move pallets.” A federal judge granted regulators a  preliminary injunction  to prevent the company from transporting “hot goods” ― that is, poultry produced in facilities where laws were allegedly broken. Exclusive Poultry could not immediately be reached for comment.

U.S. regulators have said they are dealing with a rise in child labor cases, as migrant children who fled Latin America wind up in slaughterhouses and other potentially dangerous workplaces. The agency’s wage and hour administrator said the cases tended to fall in two categories: those in which children were working more hours than the law allows, and those in which children were performing dangerous duties that the law forbids. Earlier this year, the Labor Department said its investigators found that another company, Packers Sanitation Services Inc., had employed children in cleaning roles at meatpacking plants, including using “back saws, brisket saws and head splitters.” The company agreed to pay $1.5 million in civil penalties after regulators accused it of employing at least 100 minors. Advertisement The agency recommended that supermarkets and other food sellers obtain “written assurance” from their contractors that they are following wage-and-hour law and aren’t employing children illegally.

In an exchange about holiday plans with colleague Alexa Maslowski, Bruck said: “The extent of my traveling is probably going to visit my girlfriend in Cleveland and that’s about it.” Advertisement “Girlfriend” carried heavy freight for the multimedia journalist. “I said “girlfriend” on air for the first time today, which some people may say “ok, who cares?” … but to me it’s a step toward accepting and loving myself fully and being authentic on and off the air,” she wrote alongside the clip on Instagram last month. Bruck  told People  on Monday that her decision was “spur of the moment” and it’s had lasting consequences. “Messages are pouring in from all around the world, including Ghana, Germany, Australia, London, as well as many states across the U.S.,” Bruck said. “People are telling me how much this visibility means to them and that they’re so proud of me.” Advertisement Bruck said she has been open about her sexuality on social media but an on-air acknowledgment was the icing on the cake. “When I finally said it out loud, I smiled inside because it was a big moment for me,” she said to People. Bruck might have undersold her holiday plans, though. It looks like she and girlfriend Lauren Lanzaretta are doing up the season in epic fashion. One Instagram post shows  the couple taking in a concert  of “All I Want For Christmas Is You” singer Mariah Carey.

Project Veritas did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Project Veritas is known for its heavily edited videos, like a video targeting  Planned Parenthood  in 2008, where O’Keefe and Lila Rose, the founder of an anti-abortion group,  illegally recorded Planned Parenthood employees consulting Rose, who they believed to be a 13-year-old pregnant girl . Giles and O’Keefe worked together in 2009 on a hidden-video “sting” that purportedly showed employees of the progressive  Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now  (ACORN) agreeing to aid the pair in crimes. The two, who had been employed by conservative journalist Andrew Breitbart, ended up paying settlements to one of the ACORN staffers. The organization, however, lost much of its funding despite investigations that found no wrongdoing.

You misunderstand the difference between a springing power or one that goes into immediate effect. A power of attorney document may require witnesses or notarization for validity.","“A power of attorney enables you to proactively plan for unexpected events, such as illness, injury or cognitive decline, which might render you incapable of managing your own affairs,” said David Watson, an estate planning attorney based in Mequon, Wisconsin. Beyond the mistake of not having one to begin with, HuffPost asked estate lawyers about the worst mistakes they commonly see people do with powers of attorney that they want you to avoid. You only get one POA for your health care or finances, but not both types. You misunderstand the difference between a springing power or one that goes into immediate effect. “Health care powers of attorney typically ‘spring’ into action only when the principal becomes incapacitated. Choi said that in the cases of younger people in their 30s and 40s, she would typically recommend a springing power where it “will become effective only when your doctor says, ‘Oh, OK, she doesn’t have capacity to make these decisions.’ And by attaching that letter to the power of attorney, it becomes effective.”  Meanwhile for elderly people who just need help paying bills and accounts online, a springing power of attorney could be “another hurdle” because “the doctors can’t maybe say you’re incapacitated, because you have capacity,” Choi said. Carmen Rosas, an estate planning attorney based in San Mateo, California, said people can approach their power of attorney document with a “set it and forget it” mentality out of discomfort. But this is a legal document you want to review regularly, because it can give your agent a lot of control that you may no longer want to grant if that person is now your ex or estranged child. ‘My child is not like that.’ But you know, if that’s the case, then I wouldn’t have a job.” “If your spouse is getting elderly, has trouble managing money, or any other issues, they may not be a good candidate to make any decisions for you,” Walny said. Depending on your state’s laws, a power of attorney document may require witnesses or notarization for validity. “Overlooking these essential requirements can render the document null and void,” Watson said. “When you make a committee, that often leads to confusion, delay, mistakes and other issues. “You can say things like, ‘Well, they’re able to sell [property] but not until my youngest child reaches the age of 25,’” Rosas said. If you want Medicaid planning, that better be in the document,” Walny said. “If you want broad or narrow gifting powers, that better be in the document. If you want your agent to be able to access intangible assets like your voicemails, online photos or emails, that better be in the document.” Ultimately, creating a power of attorney document will take careful research and potentially awkward conversations, but it’s worth it for the emotional, legal and financial costs you could be sparing yourself and your loved ones. “Let’s say I’m incapacitated right now today, and my husband doesn’t have power of attorney,” Choi said as an example.

Which One Is Yours?,"Each of us fits into four distinct interview archetypes: Charmers, Examiners, Harmonizers or Challengers. Challengers are great at preparing tough questions, but too many challenges can be off-putting to interviewers. Harmonizers are great collaborators, but in interviews they can place too much emphasis on the collective group.","Anna Papalia has helped thousands of college students and executives prep for job interviews throughout her career in talent acquisition and as a former teacher at Temple University’s Fox School of Business. Through researching learning styles and testing her  personality assessment  with thousands of job seekers, Papalia discovered that each of us fits into four distinct interview archetypes: Charmers, Examiners, Harmonizers or Challengers. “A lot of interviewing advice out there tells you to just memorize these perfect answers and you’ll get jobs pretending to be something that a company wants,” Papalia said. Researchers have found that we are swayed by “ looking-glass merit, ” by which hiring managers judge a candidate’s future job success based on how closely the candidate mirrors their own life and job experiences. See which interview type might fit you best, and learn how other styles think, too:  1. “They look at an interview often as a cross-examination, and they are undaunted, are really strong in interviews.” Where Challengers Self-Sabotage  The Challengers are great at preparing tough questions, but too many challenges can be off-putting to interviewers and have them thinking, ”‘OK, enough, you don’t have to poke holes in everything I’m saying. In her book, Papalia wrote that challengers can have trouble prepping for interviews because they feel fake and inauthentic. Examiners are motivated by the desire to “get it right” in interviews, Papalia said. Where Examiners Can Self-Sabotage  Examiners want to be seen as professional and capable, and they generally will speak less during interviews as a result ― which will work to their disadvantage. That’s much different than their polar opposite, a Challenger, who’s over here wanting to be respected and heard.” Advertisement Where Harmonizers Can Self-Sabotage Harmonizers are great collaborators, but in interviews they can place too much emphasis on the collective group over themselves, so much so that interviewers are left wondering, “Well, what did you do?” Papalia said. She noted that while Challengers have a “clear sense of self that is less amenable to how somebody is going respond,” the Harmonizers she’s worked with lack a clear sense of their own value. Their default is to think “I’m going to solve this or get rid of this tension by removing my needs.” Advertisement How To Win Over A Job Interviewer, No Matter Your Type  Your interview type can tell you a lot about yourself, but it’s not the whole story. But I also have the capability to tap deep into myself and be an Examiner when I need to be.”  Once you identify your personal interview styles, it can also help to think about who in your life is an opposite to you and embody what they might do in a job interview so that you can have a healthy balance of different strengths, Papalia said. If you want to win a Challenger over, ask them tough questions, Papalia recommended: “They don’t like pushovers. They love to be challenged.” Meanwhile, you can win a Charmer over with compliments and laughing at their jokes, or a Harmonizer by selling your great teamwork, or an Examiner by complimenting their professionalism and technical proficiency, Papalia said.

Sanchez’s move turned into a nightmare as he flopped at Old Trafford and joined Inter Milan in August 2019.

Jake Paul and his team have done this by announcing he’s got a fight on the 15th of December but not officially announcing his opponent. I know what you’re thinking: what impact does this make online? Well, it will get communities talking and guessing around who his potential opponent will be, meaning that Jake will likely be trending more across discussion-orientated social channels such as X. Plus, analysts and fan accounts will likely create content on YouTube predicting who his opponent will be. This skill is transferable for fight announcements and any kind of announcement you have, encouraging discussion and debate whenever producing social media content. Get creative with how you promote yourself TikTok reel from Ashley Rak-Su Following KSI vs Tommy Fury, crossover boxer Ashley Rak-Su has devised a rap summarising the highlights from the event. One thing that TikTok certainly appreciates is creative content; therefore, utilise that to your advantage. Even in the fight game, you’ll see certain fighters creatively mocking their opponents; for example, when  Crewz-Dezurn had her face-off against Savannah Marshall , she started doing a rap against Savannah, which proved unorthodox and engaging. Plus, stuff like that can get repurposed and recognised by other brands. Ash’s inspirational poem in dedication to Michael Bisping Another example involves my own brand.

The Daily Caller  reported,  “CNN Data Reporter: Trump Has CNN’s senior data reporter Harry Enten said Thursday that former President Donald Trump has the ‘strongest’ poll numbers in the ‘history’ of the Iowa caucus.” The numbers have to be discouraging for the campaigns of challengers Nikki Haley and Ron DeSantis, who are both counting on a strong showing in early states. RELATED: NSC Spokesman John Kirby Snaps At Reporter Who Suggested US Has Escalated Tensions In The Middle East The story noted, “Trump is currently leading the Republican candidates in both New Hampshire and Iowa at 46% and 51% respectively, according to RealClearPolitics. Nikki Haley is trailing Trump by 24.8% and 16% in both states respectively.” Harry Enten was emphatic about how strong Trump’s numbers were in Iowa: “It’s an enormous lead!” Enten exclaimed. And what you essentially see here is Donald Trump has only gotten stronger. And you see Ron DeSantis within the margin of error where he was in October. Look at Nikki Haley, she’s stable. This is an over 30-point advantage with Trump getting a majority of the vote. And I want to put this in a historic context for you. Just how large Trump’s lead is. All before Trump won the caucuses. I would note, in fact, Trump is the only one to actually be at greater than 50% of the vote.

Biden is reportedly planning to channel his inner George Washington in a speech commemorating the day. A recent poll shows that 25% of Americans believe FBI operatives organized and encouraged the attack.,"Opinion New Poll Shows 25% Of Americans Believe FBI Instigated January 6 Riot Screenshot: AI Generated Image - Craiyon President Joe Biden sat down with a “diverse” group of scholars and historians earlier this week to discuss the upcoming anniversary of the January 6th riots. “He’s (Biden) met with historians before ahead of an important national moment, which we’re about to see, certainly, as it relates to January 6th,”  she told reporters . “And he met with these historians — a diverse group of historians to hear … directly from them on their thoughts about our democracy here in this country and abroad,” she added. Jean-Pierre peppered in the word “diverse” three more times for good measure. RELATED:  ‘They’re Going Down’: Rep Clay Higgins Insists He’s Going After FBI Agents Who Put Trump Supporters On Terror Watchlist After January 6th Over Half Of American Voters Either Think The FBI Was Involved In January 6th, Or Aren’t Sure That diversity likely did not take into account those who do not believe the Capitol riot was on par with the Civil War. As evidenced by one of those scholars, Sean Wilentz of Princeton, who  told the Washington Post  about his lunch with Biden and how January 6th reminded him of “what the secessionists were doing in 1860-61.” Secessionists  were Democrats . “Go back and read what was going on in March 1861: They were worried about possibilities that pro-Confederates would enter the Capitol and actually disrupt the normal process of the succession of power,” Wilentz explained. Nor does Biden’s meeting with historians take into account recent polling that shows that 25% of Americans believe FBI operatives organized and encouraged the January 6th attack on the Capitol. Representative Clay Higgins (R-TX) has claimed that there may have been “over 200” undercover FBI agents posing as supporters of Donald Trump  inside  the Capitol before the riot on January 6th, 2021. RELATED:  Poll Shows 40% of Democrats Want to ‘Cancel’ George Washington Perhaps more alarming to Democrats is another recent poll that shows an increasing  number of American voters  believe the 2020 election was stolen. A new  Suffolk University poll  indicates that two-thirds (67%) of Trump supporters don’t believe Biden was legitimately elected president in 2020. This all depends on how the question was worded. While former President Trump’s claims of voter fraud have not panned out, there is ample evidence that the media and intelligence communities  worked overtime to carry Biden  to the White House. President Biden, according to reports, plans to channel his inner George Washington in a speech commemorating January 6th, a day Democrats put on par with the attack on Pearl Harbor, 9/11, and obviously, the Revolutionary War. They do so when it comes to George Washington, and they certainly have done so when it comes to January 6th. Oh wait, here’s Princeton scholar Sean Wilentz once again, suggesting that if Trump wins the 2024 presidential elections, he’ll get rid of all the  real  historians. “I don’t even want to think about what historians are going to be saying if Trump wins,” Wilentz said. Biden is meeting with historians to make sure they’re all on the same page regarding January 6th, not Trump.

Celebrity followers of the Church of Scientology include Tom Cruise, John Travolta and Elisabeth Moss.","Opinion Scientology Accused of Mafia-Style Tactics, Facing Calls for RICO Charges PictorialEvidence via Wikimedia Commons Last year Scientology made front-page headlines as one of its celebrity followers was found guilty of raping women in the early 2000s. Allegations swarmed that more women were victimized by Mr. Masterson and, worse yet, that the Church of Scientology knew and facilitated his ability to get away with these heinous crimes. The lawyers representing the women who testified against Danny Masterson in his rape trial are claiming that Scientology, and specifically their current leader David Miscavige, should be brought up on mafia-inspired RICO charges. RICO charges are levied on organizations that participate in illegal activity such as bribery, wire fraud, arson, kidnapping, extortion, and witness tampering, to name a few. RELATED:  Court Documents: Bill Clinton ‘Likes Them Young,’ Is ‘Key Person’ Who Can Provide Information On Jeffrey Epstein In addition to monitoring, the lawsuit alleges that Mr. Miscavige and the organization as a whole: “…worked with Defendant Masterson to keep his sexual assault victims from reporting their abuse and mobilized an aggressive harassment campaign against the victims once the sexual assaults were disclosed.” The original plaintiffs in the case against Danny Masterson  claim  that the church surveilled them, harassed them, and even murdered some of their pets in an attempt to intimidate and tamper with them as witnesses against one of their celebrity followers. “While presenting itself outwardly as a respectable organization, Scientology’s criminal enterprise has implemented a policy of terrorizing victims (and witnesses) of its crimes – whether or not those victims (or witnesses) are Scientologists – into keeping Scientology’s crimes secret.” There are even claims that Scientology has a policy for this very activity called the Suppressive Persons and Fair Game rule. Of what is alleged, this rule states that if a member of the church or an outsider attacks Scientology or attempts to ruin its reputation in some way, then the protections the member had prior are no more, and retaliation is authorized. Actress and former Scientologist Leah Remini claims to have been affected by this policy, given her documentary on Scientology and efforts to disclose the truth behind the organization. “Scientology’s policies regarding Suppressive Persons and Fair Game are not religious doctrine, they are old-school, mob-style tactics modernized, amplified, and weaponized by Scientology’s far-reaching network.” RELATED:  Jimmy Kimmel Loses It Over Aaron Rodgers Suggesting He Was Friends With Epstein – Threatens To Sue Proving the allegations to be true may be difficult given the shroud of secrecy and devotion church followers seem to have.

The Supreme Court is expected to rule on the matter sooner than later, as Trump has appealed the ruling. And some don’t expect that ruling to go well for the left.

Due to the extenuating circumstances, Abrams said, “there is no doubt in my mind [the Supreme Court is] going to take this case,” and “the advantage that the Donald Trump team has is that if they accept any one of the arguments, he wins.” ‘No Way’ “We could go through the five or so arguments that he has,” Abrams explained. “You have the due process argument, you have definitional arguments, you have questions about whether it’s self-executing or whether you need Congress to make laws, is the president even covered? And that’s the challenge that the other side is going to have.” Stephanopoulos replied, “I think you and I both begin from the premise that the Supreme Court simply does not want to step in and decide the election. That there’s no way they’re going to uphold the Maine decision or the Colorado decision. We may be proven wrong, but what’s the argument?” Exactly. Colorado and Maine’s supposed argument that Trump somehow violated the 14th Amendment is flimsy at best. But in the bigger picture, if your argument is that Trump somehow tried to subvert democracy on January 6, 2021, yet you are a Democrat trying to make sure voters in certain states can’t vote for their candidate of choice – who is really trying to undermine democracy? Expect the Supreme Court, as even George Stephanopoulos says, to block these ballot bans. And expect Donald Trump to benefit from these glaring threats to democracy.

Ms. Gay’s plagiarism was described as unintentional duplicative language, an excuse that no doubt would not have been afforded if it wasn’t for Ms. Gay’s arbitrary demographics. The ideology Mr. Ackman refers to is Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion, or DEI. Still, after digging deeper into the practices at Harvard, he learned that: “…DEI was not about diversity in its purest form, but rather DEI was a political advocacy movement on behalf of certain groups that are deemed oppressed under DEI’s own methodology.” To break it down, the DEI ideology claims that by virtue of an individual’s race, sex, and other arbitrary characteristics, one is inherently oppressed or the oppressor.

Billionaire Elon Musk has long decried the DEI movement and received much criticism for it. A recent  Forbes  article by James Hudson titled  What Elon Musk Does Not Understand About DEI Programs  attempted to claim that Mr. Musk and those who agree with him don’t understand DEI. “Given that the population is ~50% female, it would logically follow that 50% of senior leaders in an organization would also be female, though this is rarely the case.” Unfortunately, this example only highlights the simplistic, at best, statistical knowledge Mr. Hudson and others in his camp understand. The same can be said regarding racial demographics and any other demographic statistic.

Born in 1908 as Maria Krystyna Janina Skarbek, she was the daughter of a Polish count and, through her mother, an heir to a Jewish banking family.","13 hours ago About sharing By Tim Stokes BBC News Britain's longest-serving World War Two spy, Christine Granville, risked her life countless times carrying out missions across Europe, yet today her contribution is barely known. Who was she and why does the nation owe her such a great debt? Having survived many perilous situations on three different fronts during the course of World War Two, it was a bitter irony that she should lose her life in the apparent safety of a Kensington hotel. Granville worked for MI6 on several occasions in France, where agents had an average life-expectancy of only six weeks Born in May 1908 as Maria Krystyna Janina Skarbek, she was the daughter of a Polish count and, through her mother, an heir to a Jewish banking family. ""She was this countess who had all of these connections to varying people in the know,"" Mulley explains. Granville arrived for one mission in France by parachuting from only 200m during gale-force winds During postings for MI6 in Hungary, Egypt and France, she would carry out missions, travelling across numerous borders, sometimes hidden in the boot of a car, sometimes while fleeing machine-gun fire, and often along with one of the many lovers she had during the war. On one occasion, she received a microfilm that showed German forces lining up along the Soviet border for what looked like an imminent attack. Twice she would be captured and interrogated by the Germans but was able to spring herself free. On the same day, she discovered her Special Operations Executive (SOE) commander - and lover - had been arrested in Digne in south-east France by the Gestapo, along with two other agents, and faced being executed by a firing squad. At great risk to her own safety, she managed to free them all by storming into Digne Prison, claiming she was the niece of Field Marshal Montgomery and informing the officer in charge an American attack was imminent. Mulley says: ""By the end of an hour she's basically terrified this guy, and she says, 'You know, if you go ahead with this execution I will make sure that you are strung up. Francis Cammaerts, Granville's commander in France and lover, was one of three men she managed to get released from a Nazi prison ""There is a reason women were really useful in these [intelligence] roles,"" Mulley explains. ""Young men - some of them haven't even served in the war themselves - they just say, 'I doubt she did all this' and 'this little girl seems to be making things up' and 'she's very difficult to place'. Having served on three fronts, Granville had acquired numerous awards but was accused by her fellow workers of being a fake. You know all of these prejudices are stacked against her and she gets a really hard time,"" Mulley says. She died within seconds of the impact; this blade had gone straight through her heart,"" Mulley says. ""She falls between every category, so no-one's blowing the trumpet for her,"" Mulley says.

Moreover, the stereotype of blue-collar workers like plumbers being rugged and direct feeds into these narratives.

The deal would require founder and chief executive Jimmy Finkelstein to give up control. The company, which launched with $50 million in May, has struggled to gain traction, generating less than $5 million in revenue last year.","Conservative investors look to bail out struggling Messenger news site at a reported $60M valuation Struggling news startup the Messenger is reportedly in talks with a group of conservative media and business executives,  Axios reported late Thursday . The deal would require founder and chief executive Jimmy Finkelstein to give up control. Axios also separately reported that the Messenger, which laid off nearly  two dozen employees of its 300-person staff amid cratering cash reserves , is looking to  raise $20 million  in order to stay afloat. In regards to the investor group, Axios said they met with Finkelstein at Mar-a-Lago, the Florida private club and residence of former President Donald Trump. They included Omeed Malik, a financier who backed Tucker Carlson’s new media venture; Garrett Ventry, a Republican political operative; Ryan Coyne, founder of digital media agency Starboard; and George Farmer, the former CEO of Parler who sits on the board of Britain’s conservative news network GB News. Jimmy Finkelstein is scrambling to drum up funds for his embattled startup, the Messenger. Patrick McMullan via Getty Images Neither the Messenger nor the group responded to requests for comment. Still, if a deal goes through, it would likely cause friction inside the newsroom, which is guided by the mantra to cover the news in a nonpartisan fashion. Staffers have already chafed at Finkelstein’s close relationship with Trump. Last month, Finkelstein instructed editors to take down stories on Trump’s civil fraud trial in New York so as to not overwhelm the homepage, causing a firestorm inside the Messenger,  Semafor reported. Meanwhile, the company, which launched with $50 million in May, has struggled to gain traction, generating less than $5 million in revenue last year and failing to make a profit, according to Axios. The Messenger has struggled to bring in revenue, and it recently lost its president, Richard Beckman. The Messenger It also  lured in just 12.5 million unique visitors in November , a source with knowledge said, which is far less than the 100 million monthly readers and $100 million in revenue that Richard Beckman, the site’s president, told the New York Times earlier this year. Beckman  announced he is exiting the company on Jan. 31 , citing “short-term” health issues, but insiders told The Post that his vision for the outlet also clashed with that of Finkelstein. Following news of Beckman’s departure and layoffs at the firm, Semafor reported that the  site would shut down  by the end of the month if it did not receive an infusion of cash. Finkelstein (left) is hoping to either sell a majority stake in his firm or raise $20 million to keep the company afloat, reports said. “We have already secured investment as part of our second raise, and so the notion of us discussing closure is beyond absurd,” the rep told The Post. Meanwhile, inside the Messenger, employees are freaking out over the flurry of bad news and are demanding answers from Finkelstein and editor in chief Dan Wakeford, who has been hard to pin down. On Thursday, the Messenger’s head of communications tried to calm staffers via the company’s internal Slack channel, telling them that Finkelstein would hold meetings with employees in the coming days,  the Daily Beast first reported .",2024-01-05 17:36:17,"[0.012326221671354215, 0.25904893933820194, 0.01549250050641143, 0.008669959018679087, 0.013325957338094496, 0.005974583262323001, 0.006127966355678249, 0.9630922560922233, 0.05645748222217131, 0.00870616693133509, 0.003219614249672389, 0.007794774291487227, 0.030712483922071505, 0.018745060490598046]",,Conservative-investors-look-to-bail-out-struggling-Messenger-news-site-at-a-reported-60M-valuation.wav

He was the first to use drugs to control the rejection of donated organs. Several of the immunosuppressive drugs used today were even introduced by Sir Roy. His son Russell said he was ""an incredible person to have as a father""","12 minutes ago About sharing Sir Roy Calne's son, Russell, said he was ""an incredible person to have as a father"" By Lewis Adams BBC News, Cambridgeshire Pioneering British surgeon Prof Sir Roy Calne, who undertook the first liver transplant operation in Europe, has died at the age of 93. Sir Roy led the operation at Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge in 1968, a year after the US's first successful liver transplant. The world-leading surgeon, who died of heart failure overnight on Saturday, received a Pride of Britain award for his life's work. His son Russell said he was ""an incredible person to have as a father"". ""He was an amazing character, a slight eccentric and a wonderful father to six children,"" Mr Calne said. ""We were all very, very proud of him for everything he has achieved and done, and we've been to some amazing places due to his accolades."" 'Illustrious career' Born in Richmond, Surrey, Sir Roy was educated at Lancing College before having his medical training at Guys Hospital in London. He was the first to use drugs to control the rejection of donated organs and this led to a major expansion of organ grafting worldwide. The pioneering surgeon won the Pride of Britain award for lifetime achievement in 2014 Several of the immunosuppressive drugs used today were even introduced by Sir Roy. The world-class surgeon went on to start a kidney transplant programme in Cambridge in 1965, before he performed the first liver transplant in Europe three years later. Sir Roy's work saw him elected as a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1974 and knighted in 1986. The following year, he undertook the world's first liver, heart and lung transplant with the Royal Papworth Hospital's John Wallwork. He collected numerous accolades including the Pride of Britain award for lifetime achievement in 2014. Sir Roy's work saw him receive a knighthood in 1986 ""He was very driven by his work and he was also very widely academic as well,"" Mr Calne said. ""He used to have nightmares about patients that had died; it wasn't all roses for him, it was stressful but he never showed that."" Sir Roy loved sport and would squeeze in a game of squash around lengthy operations if he could, his son added. He continued to ski up to the age of 75 and played tennis until he was 80. ""He was very much a down to earth person who looked after the little people, that was part of his forte,"" Mr Calne said. ""Though a genius he never portrayed it to us, we were only ever shown love by him.""

""Bird mortality has become an unintended consequence of renewable energy development,"" says Hannah Vander Zanden, assistant professor of biology at the University of Florida.","""Bird mortality has become an unintended consequence of renewable energy development,"" said Hannah Vander Zanden, an assistant professor of biology at the University of Florida. ""If we want to minimize or even offset these fatalities, especially for vulnerable populations, we need to identify the geographic origin of affected birds. In other words, are the dead birds local or are they coming from other parts of North America?"" Birds can be killed when they collide with wind turbines, fly into solar panels they mistake for bodies of water or become singed by the intense heat from concentrating solar power plants. While the death rate of birds due to these energy facilities is far less than deaths due to domestic cats and collisions with building, efforts to mitigate this problem is important, scientists say. Vander Zanden and colleagues performed geospatial analyses of stable hydrogen isotope data obtained from feathers of 871 individual birds found dead at solar and wind energy facilities in California, representing 24 species. Their analysis of natural-occurring markers in the feathers provided information about where the feathers were grown based on the water the birds consumed. ""With these markers, we could determine whether the bird was local or if it was migrating from somewhere else,"" said Vander Zanden, who is the principal investigator of UF's Animal Migration and Ecology Lab. Results from the study, which were published Friday in the journal  Conservation Biology , show that the birds killed at the facilities were from a broad area across the continent. Their geographical origins varied among species and included a mix of local and nonlocal birds. Researchers found most birds killed at solar facilities were nonlocal and peaked during the migratory periods of April and September through October. The percentage of migratory birds found at wind facilities nearly matched that of local birds, at 51%, Vander Zanden said. ""This kind of data can help inform us about best strategies to use to minimize or mitigate the fatalities,"" she said. ""For example, facilities management could work with conservationists to improve the local habitat to help protect local birds or improve other parts of the species' range where the migratory birds originate."" The results also illustrate the power of stable isotope data to assess future population growth or decline patterns for birds due to a variety of reasons. ""Studying the remains of animals is a noninvasive approach to get information that is otherwise hard to track and apply to conservation,"" Vander Zanden said. ""It's a great way to understand the mysteries about animals.""",2024-01-05 19:51:41,"[0.004657702107963615, 0.004690111745882725, 0.003686226151161902, 0.0018162347796753667, 0.0035162243327244444, 0.0012061060903617758, 0.9979118997508635, 0.0016350783757687387, 0.00532553697818642, 0.0021935350638407408, 0.06355980428040374, 0.0022122438455974064, 0.0036371489916122044, 0.0019040703179370522]",,Feathers-from-deceased-birds-help-scientists-understand-new-threat-to-avian-populations.wav

Overall, the survey's results are positive: There are the same number of elephants now as there were 25 years ago. Some areas, such as south Tanzania, eastern Zambia, and northern Zimbabwe, experienced severe declines.","The evidence suggests that the long-term solution to elephant survival requires not only that areas are protected but that they are also connected to allow populations to stabilize naturally, an international research team says. Their study, published on January 5th in the peer-reviewed journal  Science Advances , collected survey estimates and calculated growth rates for more than 100 elephant populations in southern Africa between 1995 and 2020, accounting for an estimated 70% of the global savanna elephant population. ""This is the most comprehensive analysis of growth rates for any large mammal population in the world,"" said co-author Rob Guldemond, director of the Conservation Ecological Research Unit (CERU) at the University of Pretoria, in South Africa. Overall, the survey's results are positive: There are the same number of elephants now as there were 25 years ago, a rare conservation win at a time when the planet is rapidly losing biodiversity. However, the pattern is not consistent across regions. Some areas, such as south Tanzania, eastern Zambia, and northern Zimbabwe, experienced severe declines due to illegal ivory poaching. ""Unchecked growth isn't necessarily a good thing, however,"" says study co-author Stuart Pimm, the Doris Duke Professor of Conservation at Duke University in North Carolina. ""Rapidly increasing populations can outgrow and damage their local environment and prove hard to manage -- introducing a threat to their long-term stability,"" Pimm says. In addition to documenting local growth rates, the team also looked at the features of the local populations to identify what makes them stable, that is neither growing nor declining. These elephants will likely need future conservation interventions, such as translocation or birth control, which are both costly and intensive endeavors. The team found that the most stable populations occur in large, core areas that are surrounded by buffer zones. The core areas are defined by their strong levels of environmental protection and minimal human impact, whereas the buffers allow some activities such as sustainable farming, forestry, or trophy hunting. ""What's crucial is that you need a mix of areas with more stable core populations linked to more variable buffer areas,"" said lead author Ryan Huang, a Duke Ph.D. now doing postdoctoral research at CERU. ""These buffers absorb immigrants when core populations get too high, but also provide escape routes when elephants face poor environmental conditions or other threats such as poaching,"" Huang said. Connecting protected areas means elephants can freely move in and out. This allows a natural equilibrium to occur without human intervention, sparing conservationists from using their limited resources to maintain balance. ""Calling for connecting parks isn't something new. ""But surprisingly, there has not been a lot of published evidence of its effectiveness so far. ""Connecting protected areas is essential for the survival of African savanna elephants and many other animal and plant species,"" said Celesté Maré, co-author and doctoral student at Aarhus University in Denmark. ""Populations with more options for moving around are healthier and more stable, which is important given an uncertain future from climate change.""",2024-01-05 19:51:35,"[0.007190989417376274, 0.009059339420334442, 0.006992154927924744, 0.0033024393243817024, 0.006285180887004754, 0.002480666266731271, 0.9302024667430954, 0.002665766120677292, 0.00795337831127672, 0.003772067044667452, 0.366513175084464, 0.004139584653153331, 0.006237872821200936, 0.0034043518178052067]",,Protected-areas-for-elephants-work-best-if-they-are-connected.wav

Ultrastructural analyses in fossil cells from 2 formations (Australia, Canada) revealed the presence of internal membranes with an arrangement, fine structure and dimensions permitting to interpret them unambiguously as thylakoid membranes, where oxygenic photosynthesis occurs. These observations permitted to identify  N majensis  as a fossil cyanobacterium. This discovery puts into perspective the role of cyanobacteria with thylakoid membranes in early Earth oxygenation. They played an important role in the early evolution of life and were active during the Great Oxygenation Event (GOE), around 2.4 billion years ago. However, the chronology of the origins of oxygenic photosynthesis and the type of cyanobacteria (protocyanobacteria -- With or without thylakoids -- ) involved remain debated, and the ULiège researchers' discovery offers a new approach to clarify these issues. ""The oldest known fossil thylakoids date back to around 550 million years. The ones we have identified therefore extend the fossil record by 1.2 billion years,"" explains Professor Emmanuelle Javaux, paleobiologist and astrobiologist, director of the Early Life Traces & Evolution laboratory at ULiège. ""The discovery of preserved thylakoids in  N. majensis  provides direct evidence of a minimum age of around 1.75 billion years for the divergence between cyanobacteria with thylakoids and those without."" But the ULiège team's discovery raises the possibility to discover thylakoids in even older cyanobacterial fossils, and to test the hypothesis that the emergence of thylakoids may have played a major role in the great oxygenation of the early Earth around 2.4 billion years ago. This approach also permits to examine the role of dioxygen in the evolution of complex life (eucaryote) on our planet, including the origin and early diversification of algae that host chloroplasts derived from cyanobacteria. ""Microscopic life is beautiful, the most diverse and abundant form of life on Earth since the origin of life.

""The only available data for the composition of the clouds were collected by probes and revealed strange properties of the clouds that so far we have been unable to fully explain,"" said Paul Rimmer from the Cavendish Laboratory and co-author of the study. ""In particular, when examined under UV light, the Venusian clouds featured a specific UV absorption pattern. What elements, compounds, or minerals are responsible for such observation?"" Formulated on the basis of Venusian atmospheric chemistry, the team synthesized several iron-bearing sulfate minerals in an aqueous geochemistry laboratory in the Department of Earth Sciences. By suspending the synthesized materials in varying concentrations of sulfuric acid and monitor the chemical and mineralogical changes, the team narrowed down the candidate minerals to rhomboclase and acid ferric sulfate, of which the spectroscopic features were examined under light sources specifically designed to mimic the spectrum of solar flares (Paul Rimmer and Samantha Thompson's FlareLab at the Cavendish Laboratory).

The technology has potential for scaling to cover vehicles, billboards and even buildings. The invention was demonstrated to possess a desirable combination of capabilities in the ultraviolet, visible and near-infrared parts of the electromagnetic spectrum.","According to its inventors, new devices made possible by this innovation will benefit from dynamically adjustable fluorescent and spectroscopic properties, ease of manufacturing, and potential for scaling to areas large enough to cover vehicles, billboards and even buildings. The bio-inspired creation is the subject of a study published recently in  Nature Communications . Hapalochlaena lunulata  is a species of octopus native to the Western Pacific Ocean and Indian Ocean. It uses a neurotoxin venom to stun its prey and can ward off predators with a flash of its blue rings. ""We are fascinated by the mechanisms underpinning the blue-ringed octopus' ability to rapidly switch its skin markings between hidden and exposed states,"" said senior co-author Alon Gorodetsky, UCI professor of chemical and biomolecular engineering. ""For this project, we worked to mimic the octopus' natural abilities with devices from unique materials we synthesized in our laboratory, and the result is an octopus-inspired deception and signaling system that is straightforward to fabricate, functions for a long time when operated continuously, and can even repair itself when damaged."" The architecture of the innovation calls for a thin film consisting of wrinkled blue rings surrounding brown circles -- much like those on the octopus -- sandwiched between a topmost transparent proton-conducting electrode and an underlying acrylic membrane, with another identical electrode underneath. Further technical creativity by the researchers occurs at the molecular level as they explored the use of acenes, which are organic compounds made up of linearly fused benzene rings. Designer nonacene-like molecules (with nine linearly fused rings) used by the team help give the platform some of its outstanding capabilities, according to Gorodetsky. ""For our devices, we conceptualized and designed a nonacene-like molecule with a unique architecture,"" said co-lead author Preeta Pratakshya, who recently received her Ph.D. in UCI's Department of Chemistry. ""Acenes are organic hydrocarbon molecules with a host of advantageous characteristics, including ease of synthesis, tunable electronic characteristics, and controllable optical properties."" She added, ""Our nonacene-like molecules are exceptional among acenes because they can survive years of storage in air and over a day of continuous irradiation with bright light in air. No other expanded acene displays this combined long-term stability under such harsh conditions."" According to Gorodetsky, the type of molecules used to fabricate the colored blue ring layer are what endow the devices with their most favorable features, including adjustable spectroscopic properties, the facilitation of straightforward benchtop manufacturing and ambient-atmosphere stability under illumination. ""Our co-author Sahar Sharifzadeh, a Boston University professor of electrical and computer engineering, demonstrated that the stimuli-responsive properties of the molecules can be computationally predicted, which opens paths for the  in silico  design of other camouflage technologies,"" Gorodetsky said. In their laboratory tests, many of which happened in UCI's California Institute for Telecommunications and Information Technology, the team found that the bioinspired devices could change their visible appearance over 500 times with little or no degradation, and they also could autonomously self-repair without user intervention. The invention was demonstrated to possess a desirable combination of capabilities in the ultraviolet, visible light, and near-infrared parts of the electromagnetic spectrum, according to Gorodetsky. This would enable the devices to disguise other objects from detection or to clandestinely signal observers. ""The photophysical robustness and general processability of our nonacene-like molecule -- and presumably its variants -- opens opportunities for future investigation of these compounds within the context of traditional optoelectronic systems such as light-emitting diodes and solar cells,"" added Gorodetsky.

Vulcan could be ULA’s opportunity to snatch back some of that market share, which is particularly important for it because the company is now for sale. Potential buyers include Jeff Bezos’s space flight company Blue Origin, among others. If all goes well with this launch, there are six more planned for 2024. Advertisement The launch is meant to shuttle the Peregrine lander to the lunar surface. If it is successful, this will mark the first time a private company has successfully  landed on the moon . The lander carries a variety of scientific instruments, including sensors to study lunar water and radiation on the surface of the moon, both of which are key to understand for future human exploration. The CLPS programme includes many other moon missions in the coming years, which will make complementary measurements to prepare for a sustained human presence on the moon. The rocket also has two particularly controversial payloads aboard – capsules of human cremains being sent to space by a company called Celestis, which provides what it called “memorial spaceflights”. One of these capsules contains the ashes of  Star Trek  creator Gene Roddenberry and actors James Doohan and Nichelle Nichols, due to be placed in orbit around the sun, and the other contains other human ashes bound for the moon.

Sign up to newsletter Buu Nygren, the leader of the Navajo Nation,  sent a letter  to the US government objecting to the inclusion of this capsule, stating: “The placement of human remains on the moon is a profound desecration of this celestial body revered by our people.” NASA responded that because this is a private mission, the agency does not have power over what payloads it carries.

NASA’s Voyager 2 spacecraft flew past the outer planets in the 1980s and sent back photos showing that Uranus and Neptune were markedly different colours. Advertisement This is puzzling, given their similar size, mass and chemical make-up. Models of the planets’ atmospheres can explain some  of the variation  – such as a “haze layer” that is thicker on Uranus and reflects more white light, making the planet appear lighter – but these don’t fully explain why the planets should have such different hues. Now,  Patrick Irwin  at the University of Oxford and his colleagues have processed the Voyager 2 images to show how the human eye might see the planets. The original photos of Neptune taken by Voyager 2 had an enhanced contrast ratio to highlight hard-to-see atmospheric features. Along with the way that the colours were balanced to make a final composite image, this made the planet appear bluer. Voyage across the galaxy and beyond with our space newsletter every month. Sign up to newsletter Scientists at the time knew this and included these changes in picture captions, but over time the captions were separated from the images and Neptune’s deep blue shade became enshrined as fact in the public consciousness, says Irwin. Images of Uranus (left) and Neptune (right) produced previously and in the new study Patrick Irwin He and his team developed a model to convert the raw image data to a true-colour image using shots taken by the Hubble Space Telescope, which contain more complete information about the light. This produced similar shades for both planets. “The true-colour image is much more boring and bland because of the way the eye works,” says Irwin. The researchers also used the Hubble images, along with images from Lowell Observatory in Arizona, to build a model that predicts how Uranus’s colour changes during its long, 84-year orbit around the sun. Because of the planet’s spin, we see more of the equator during the equinoxes and more of the poles during the solstices. At the equator, there is more methane, which absorbs red light. The planet also has a hood of reflective, brightening ice particles that forms at the sun-facing pole during the equinoxes, increasing the reflectivity of red and green wavelengths. This helps explain the long-standing mystery of why Uranus appears slightly greener in its solstices. “We knew there was a hood, and we knew there’s less methane at the poles, but no one had put it all together to explain what’s actually happening seasonally,” says Irwin.
