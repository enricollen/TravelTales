Police declared a major incident in Tameside at about 23:45 GMT on Wednesday ""due to the severity of the damage caused and potential risk to public safety"". Around a hundred homes have been damaged and people are being asked to avoid the area. The Millbrook and Carrbrook areas in Stalybridge were worst affected. Cars were also damaged as debris fell on windscreens during Storm Gerrit Carrbrook resident John Spence told  BBC Radio Manchester : ""I thought the windows were going to come in."" ""I was scared of going out,"" he said. ""It snapped my flagpole like a twig and took a tree down in my back garden that fell on the conservatory."" Elsewhere in the UK Storm Gerrit has brought flooding and disrupted travel, with Scotland being the worst affected area. The north-west of England, the southern coast, Wales, and Northern Ireland were also covered by Met Office yellow weather warnings on Wednesday, with heavy rain and wind battering those areas. A fallen tree blocking the road in Millbrook Police declared a major incident at about 23:45 GMT on Wednesday Fire and Ambulance crews and officials from Electricity North West and the council were also called to multiple sites across Tameside and a rest centre has been set up at Dukinfield Town Hall. A tree has crashed through a roof on Grenville Street in Millbrook, with residents evacuated by the emergency services late at night. In the daylight they are confronted with the impact of what has happened and are waiting by the police cordon to find out when they will be allowed back inside. They think it only lasted for about thirty seconds, but in that short time, the lead lying on the ground, which is too heavy to lift, was blown off their roofs and onto the cars below. Greater Manchester Police said the damage had been caused ""due to a localised tornado"". Ch Supt Mark Dexter said: ""This incident has undoubtedly affected numerous people in the Stalybridge area with many residents displaced from their properties during the night. ""Our highest priority is keeping people safe which is why we are advising those who have been displaced not to return or enter their properties which have significant damage until they have been assessed by structural engineers."" ""This has understandably caused some disruption and, though we are not yet in a position to confirm when the area will return to normal, further updates will be communicated when we have them.""

Eleven properties in Cupar, Fife, were evacuated due to flooding while drivers on the A9 in the Highlands were stranded by snow on Wednesday evening. The road was shut at Scrabster due to a landslide though one lane has reopened. Power company SSEN said customers in the north east and Shetland had been worst affected, with some power outages likely to continue into Friday. Graeme Keddie, SSEN's director of corporate affairs, said that by 07:30 on Thursday about 14,000 homes were still without power after 31,000 had been reconnected. Most of those affected are in the north east or Shetland, he told BBC Radio's  Good Morning Scotland . Mr Keddie said engineers had made ""really good progress"" despite ""extremely tough conditions"".

Mr Keddie insisted the firm had made ""big improvements"" on its main network and customer communications after thousands were left without power for a week following  Storm Arwen  in 2021.

""Many of my constituents asking why this wasn't amber."" A Met Office spokesperson told BBC Scotland News that the warning was not raised to amber because ""the likelihood of disruption on a county scale remained too low to escalate until a very short lead time"".

Benny Gantz said the IDF would intervene if the world and the Lebanese government did not stop militants from firing on northern Israel. Time for a diplomatic solution was running out, he added. Cross-border exchanges of fire have been escalating since Hamas's 7 October attacks on Israel. It has led to concerns the conflict in Gaza could become wider across the region. ""The situation on Israel's northern border demands change,"" Mr Gantz told a press conference on Wednesday night. ""The stopwatch for a diplomatic solution is running out, if the world and the Lebanese government don't act in order to prevent the firing on Israel's northern residents, and to distance Hezbollah from the border, the IDF will do it."" There has been an increase in rocket fire and the use of weaponised drones by Hezbollah this week, with Israeli war planes quick to respond. State media in Lebanon reported on Wednesday that a Hezbollah fighter and two of his relatives had been killed in an Israeli air strike. The attack reportedly hit a house in Bint Jbeil, a town about 2km (1.2 miles) from the border with Israel. Benny Gantz, an opposition figure, agreed to enter into an emergency government with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in the wake of the 7 October attacks A Hezbollah statement said one of the victims, Ibrahim Bazzi, was an Australian citizen who was visiting his family. More than 100 people have been killed in Lebanon - most of them Hezbollah fighters but civilians, including three journalists, are also among the dead. Hezbollah, a Shia Muslim organisation, is designated a terrorist organisation by Western states, Israel, Gulf Arab countries and the Arab League. Its leadership praised the unprecedented cross-border attack launched by Hamas gunmen on southern Israel on 7 October, in which at least 1,200 people were killed - most of them civilians - and about 240 others were taken hostage. More than 21,100 people have been killed in Gaza - mostly children and women - during 11 weeks of fighting, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.

That lag is due largely to Biden having a narrow Democratic majority in the Senate and “unprecedented’ opposition from Republicans. To date, Biden has confirmed 39 appeals court judges.","Advertisement After a breakneck pace of confirming judges during his first two years in office, Biden, for the first time, fell behind  Donald Trump ’s number of confirmations by this point in his presidency, despite  Democrats  controlling the Senate. All six are relatively young, meaning that they likely have decades ahead of them in their lifetime appointments. These include now-U.S. District Judge Dale Ho, 46, who was  a prominent voting rights attorney  with the American Civil Liberties Union. That alone is an extraordinary feat given, again, how white and male the nation’s courts have always been. “This legal experience is underrepresented in our judiciary, and it matters,” said Zwarensteyn. “Judges rule on issues related to health care, voting rights and so much more that impacts our daily lives, so it is especially meaningful to see brilliant civil rights lawyers ascend to the bench directly from our nation’s civil and human rights and public interest organizations.” Supreme Court Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson (right) greets President Joe Biden before his State of the Union address at the U.S. Capitol on Feb. 7, 2023. That lag is due largely to Biden having a narrow Democratic majority in the Senate and “unprecedented” opposition from Republicans, which left him “little room to spare,” said Russell Wheeler, a visiting fellow with the Brookings Institution’s governance studies program and president of the Governance Institute, a nonpartisan think tank. Meanwhile, the median number of “no” votes on Biden’s 57 district court nominees this year was 44. Still, Wheeler said he suspected that Biden’s biggest disappointment in 2023 was the failure of retirement-eligible appeals court judges to create vacancies for him to fill, especially those who were appointed by Democratic presidents. “Barring some major upheaval in 2024, there’s no way Biden can match Trump’s four-year total of 54 court of appeals appointees.” To date, Biden has confirmed 39 appeals court judges. C-SPAN Faleschini was hopeful about Biden catching up to Trump’s judicial confirmations in 2024, even though it’s an election year and lawmakers will increasingly turn their focus to their own contests. Advertisement “I am slightly disappointed,” he said of Biden’s pace in 2023, “but given the quality of the nominees, it’s forgivable.” Tobias, too, said he is “cautiously optimistic” that Biden and Senate Democrats will expedite confirmations. He noted that, more recently, Republicans have been working with the White House to agree on filling vacancies in their states. It’s a sign that at least some GOP senators are willing to compromise with Biden on nominating court picks in their states, versus  unilaterally blocking all of his picks  through an arcane tradition in the Judiciary Committee. “I found it heartening” that Biden announced five judicial nominees this month from states led by two Republicans, Tobias said. “More packages like this would enable Biden to surpass Trump’s district appointees and perhaps approach his appellate confirmees.” Marge Baker, an executive vice president of People for the American Way, a progressive advocacy group, said that Biden “deserves congratulations for the stunning diversity of his judicial nominees,” but emphasized that he and Democrats must keep their eye on the ball in 2024.

Nikki Haley speaks during a Town Hall event in Agency, Iowa, on Dec. 19. CHRISTIAN MONTERROSA via Getty Images Advertisement Haley, who served six years as South Carolina’s governor, has been competing for a distant second place to Donald Trump for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination. She has frequently said during her campaign that she would compete in the first three states before returning “to the sweet state of South Carolina, and we’ll finish it” in the  Feb. 24 primary . Haley’s campaign did not immediately return a message seeking comment on her response. As she ran for governor in 2010, Haley, in an interview with a now-defunct activist group then known as The Palmetto Patriots, described the war as between two disparate sides fighting for “tradition” and “change” and said the Confederate flag was “not something that is racist.” During that same campaign, she dismissed the need for the flag to come down from the Statehouse grounds, portraying her Democratic rival’s push for its removal as a desperate political stunt. Five years later, Haley urged lawmakers to remove the flag from its perch near a Confederate soldier monument following a mass shooting in which a white gunman killed eight Black church members who were attending Bible study. On Wednesday night, Christale Spain — elected this year as the first Black woman to chair South Carolina’s Democratic Party — said Haley’s response was “vile, but unsurprising.” “The same person who refused to take down the Confederate Flag until the tragedy in Charleston, and tried to justify a Confederate History Month,” Spain said in a post on X, of Haley. Jaime Harrison, current chairman of the Democratic National Committee and South Carolina’s party chairman during part of Haley’s tenure as governor, said her response was “not stunning if you were a Black resident in SC when she was Governor.” “Same person who said the confederate flag was about tradition & heritage and as a minority woman she was the right person to defend keeping it on state house grounds,” Harrison posted Wednesday night on X. “Some may have forgotten but I haven’t.

Recently, one bus unloaded migrants overnight at a gas station in Kankakee, roughly 70 miles (110 kilometers) from Chicago.

More than 26,000 migrants have arrived in the city since last year. Adams said New York City would put similar rules in place as Chicago and announced an executive order Wednesday requesting buses arrive only between 8:30 a.m. and noon on weekdays at a single drop-off site, or face fines, lawsuits or buses being impounded. In New York, more than 161,000 migrants have arrived and sought city aid since spring 2022, including 4,000 just last week, Adams and other officials said earlier in the week. The Democratic mayors met  last month  with President Joe Biden, which followed  a letter  requesting more help. They want more federal funds, efforts to  expand work authorization , and a schedule for when buses arrive.

The ITC, a federal agency, ordered the halt in October to block Apple from using specific technologies underpinning a blood-oxygen measurement system in its Series 9 and Ultra 2 watches. Apple has been embroiled in an intellectual property dispute with the medical technology company Masimo over those technologies.

The two watch models will be available at Apple’s online store by noon Pacific Time on Thursday, according to the company. They will return to some Apple stores Wednesday, with wider availability expected by Saturday. That dispute hasn’t directly affected Apple Watch sales yet because another regulatory body had ruled that AliveCor’s technology isn’t patentable. The legal tussle on that issue is still ongoing. The patent headaches facing Apple as it tries to infuse more medical technology into its watch models make it increasingly likely the company will either have to start working out licensing deals or simply acquiring startups specializing in the field, Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives predicted.

The complaint says Trader Joe’s should have to send Andrade a letter “apologizing for any hardship or distress caused by his discharge.” In a phone interview, Andrade, 46, said he was pleased to see that prosecutors found merit in his story. “I hope that the union can keep chalking up some wins and we can hold the company accountable for their practices and trying to union-bust,” Andrade said. But I know that’s not how capitalism works these days.” The complaint also states that Trader Joe’s retaliated against union workers in Massachusetts and Minnesota by providing them with lesser 401(k) contributions than non-union workers. Officials say the move was intended to “discourage employees from engaging” in their protected rights. Trader Joe’s, which is based in Monrovia, California, did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Wednesday.

Three men, aged 48, 59 and 69, were killed after a boat with 11 people on board capsized in rough weather in Moreton Bay off the south Queensland coast on Tuesday, police said. Ambulances took eight survivors to a hospital in stable conditions. Queensland Police Acting Chief Superintendent Andrew Pilotto said those rescued were lucky to survive. “The storm was still raging when they were rescued,"" Pilotto said. ""It would have been very difficult to survive in those conditions anywhere.” Elsewhere, a 59-year-old woman was killed by a falling tree in the Queensland city of Gold Coast on Monday night. The body of a 9-year-old girl was found on Tuesday in the neighboring city of Brisbane hours after she disappeared in a flooded stormwater drain. They were among three women swept into the flooded river through a stormwater drain on Tuesday. Queensland Police Commissioner Katarina Carroll blamed “extraordinarily difficult weather” for the tragedies. “It has been a very tragic 24 hours due to the weather,” Carroll told reporters. Severe weather has lashed parts of southeast Australia since Monday including Queensland and Victoria. A woman, who is yet to be identified, was found dead late Tuesday after flash flooding receded at a campground in Buchan in regional Victoria. Also on Tuesday, a 44-year-old man was killed by a falling branch on his rural property in Caringal in eastern Victoria.

He had been incarcerated in central Russia’s Vladimir region. Supporters said he couldn’t be found beginning on Dec. 6. Prisoner transfers in Russia often result in contact with inmates being lost for weeks.,"MOSCOW (AP) — Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny on Tuesday released a sardonic statement about  his transfer to a Arctic prison colony  nicknamed the “Polar Wolf,” his first appearance since associates lost contact with him three weeks ago. Navalny, the most prominent and persistent domestic foe of President Vladimir Putin, is serving a 19-year sentence on an extremism conviction. He had been incarcerated in central Russia’s Vladimir region, about 230 kilometers (140 miles) east of Moscow, but supporters said he couldn’t be found beginning on Dec. 6. Advertisement They said Monday that he had been traced to a prison colony infamous for severe conditions in the Yamalo-Nenets region, about 1,900 kilometers (1,200 miles) northeast of Moscow. Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny, seen on a TV screen as he appears in a video link provided by the Russian Federal Penitentiary Service from the colony in Melekhovo, Vladimir region, during a hearing at the Russian Supreme Court in Moscow, Russia, on Wednesday, Aug. 23, 2023. (AP Photo/Alexander Zemlianichenko The region is notorious for long and severe winters. Advertisement Navalny, who is noted for sharply humorous comments, said he was in a good mood after being transported to the new prison, but suggested the northern winter darkness is discouraging: “I don’t say ‘Ho-ho-ho,’ but I do say ‘Oh-oh-oh’ when I look out of the window, where I can see night, then the evening, and then the night again.” Prisoner transfers in Russia often result in contact with inmates being lost for weeks. Navalny’s supporters contend the transfer was arranged to keep Navalny out of sight amid Putin’s announcement that he will run for another term as president in the March election. Navalny has been behind bars in Russia since January 2021, when he  returned to Moscow  after recuperating in Germany from nerve agent poisoning that he blamed on the Kremlin. Before his arrest, he campaigned against official corruption and organized major anti-Kremlin protests. He has rejected all charges against him as politically motivated.

But it’s such an honor and and hopefully I look forward to 37 more years of doing it, when I’ll be a very, very old man.” Jennings started hosting “Jeopardy!” in 2021 and also led “Celebrity Jeopardy!” after Trebek, who had pancreatic cancer,  died in 2020 . Sony initially chose Mike Richards, a longtime producer of the show, to succeed Trebek. But he  stepped down  within two weeks amid multiple controversies, including a history of sexist comments.

The statement arrives less than two weeks after Ye went on an antisemitic rant in Las Vegas. He also once suggested slavery was a choice and called the coronavirus vaccine “the mark of the beast.,"The  rapper formerly known as Kanye West,  who has a long history of making antisemitic comments, apologized to the Jewish community in an Instagram post written in Hebrew on Tuesday. “I sincerely apologize to the Jewish community for any unintended outburst caused by my words or actions,” Ye wrote. Advertisement “It was not my intention to offend or demean, and I deeply regret any pain I may have caused,” continued the rapper, who  legally changed his name to Ye in 2021. The statement arrives less than two weeks after Ye went on an antisemitic rant in Las Vegas while promoting his upcoming album “Vultures,” due out Jan. 12. “After causing untold damage by using his vast influence and platform to poison countless minds with vicious antisemitism and hate, an apology in Hebrew may be the first step on a long journey towards making amends to the Jewish community and all those who he has hurt,” the Anti-Defamation League said in a statement to The Associated Press and other news outlets on Tuesday. “Ultimately, actions will speak louder than words but this initial act of contrition is welcome.” The American Jewish Committee, however, criticized Ye’s use of Hebrew in the apology. “To be sure, using Hebrew to communicate with the Jewish community intentionally denies most American Jews— and, consequently, non-Jews—the ability to directly see Kanye’s apology.” Advertisement “While he claims that he is committed to learning and greater understanding, this apology speaks to ‘any pain I may have caused,’ rather than acknowledging the pain that he has caused,” the AJC continued. He also once suggested slavery was a choice and called the coronavirus vaccine “the mark of the beast.” In October 2022, he was criticized for wearing a “White Lives Matter” T-shirt at  his Paris Fashion Week show  and tweeted that he was going to go “death con 3 on JEWISH PEOPLE,” an apparent reference to the U.S. defense readiness condition scale, DEFCON. Later that month, the  Balenciaga fashion house cut ties  with Ye and he  lost the lucrative partnership with Adidas  that helped catapult him to billionaire status over his remarks. Adidas has sold hundreds of millions of euros  in remaining Yeezy shoes,  donating part of the profits to groups like the Anti-Defamation League and the Philonise & Keeta Floyd Institute for Social Change. (Recently, though,  Adidas CEO Bjørn Gulden said on a podcast episode  that he didn’t think Ye “meant what he said and I don’t think he’s a bad person.” Gulden  later apologized,  the Anti-Defamation League said.) He was  locked out of his accounts on Instagram and what was then known as Twitter,  though he has since returned to both platforms. But less than two months later, he told  conspiracy theorist and host Alex Jones  that he sees “good things about Hitler.” “We’ve seen this behavior from Kanye before — the antisemitic rant and the follow-up apology,” the American Jewish Committee said. Ye’s latest apology ends with him saying he’s committed to “learning from this experience” and plans on “making amends.” A representative for Ye did not immediately respond to the AP’s request for further comment.

Literally Media, which owns Know Your Meme, Cracked and other brands, acquired Mel for an undisclosed amount. Originally a content site for the Dollar Shave Club, Mel was once  “the rare men’s magazine.”","Men are so back: Mel magazine, an audacious digital media site for the guys, will get a new lease on life next year after its unceremonious dissolution in 2022. Literally Media, which owns Know Your Meme, Cracked and other brands, announced Friday that it acquired Mel magazine for an undisclosed amount. Originally a content site for the Dollar Shave Club, Mel was  once  “the rare men’s magazine that has taken upon itself to investigate masculinity, not enforce it.” Advertisement Oren Katzeff, CEO of Literally Media, told HuffPost that he wanted to acquire Mel for its unique voice and a loyal audience. When you make an acquisition like this, you have to be very respectful of that while also thinking about how to expand and grow the voice into the next chapter of the brand.” Mel doesn’t have an editor-in-chief or any writers yet, but the magazine will start publishing next year. Katzeff said he would like to have three to five people on staff with a mix of full-time and freelance employees and then “grow from there.” Katzeff said he plans to package Mel “with opportunities beyond the articles on site,” which will include a newsletter strategy as well as introducing video, which will open “more doors” to brand deals. Advertisement “There’s really a ripe opportunity for Mel to expand beyond just the website into at the very least video and possibly audio as well,” Katzeff said. “Literally Media as a company years ago was probably doing anywhere from 10 to 15 million video views a month, and now we’re doing in the hundreds of millions. So I’m pretty bullish in terms of Mel’s opportunity in both the video and audio space moving forward.” Mel magazine’s stories included headlines like  “Our Eternal Horniness for the Camp Counselor”  and  “I Tried Mark Wahlberg’s Catholic App to See If It Could Reconnect Me With God.”  Mel magazine reached 4 million unique monthly visitors during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, according to a news release, but in  March 2021, it ceased publication . A few months later, Recurrent Ventures acquired it only to pull the plug in 2022  and lay off all staff members . Mel magazine is the most recent digital media outlet Paste magazine acquired Jezebel , the women’s publication, after it shuttered in November. Katzeff said it’s “more challenging that ever” to run a successful media company. “I think we’ll be seeing more opportunities like these, I think we’ll be seeing more collaborations moving forward,” he said. “And, you know, what I hope with an acquisition like this is that we can also leverage some of the success we’ve had with our other brands to help revive some of the audience on Mel. “I think the power of a network is something that you get to enjoy that you don’t necessarily get as an independent entity. And so, my guess would be as we go into 2024, if the market conditions continue as they are, which is, again, greater challenges in terms of audience, greater challenges in terms of monetization, I think we may see more and more opportunities like these.” Advertisement Support HuffPost The Stakes Have Never Been Higher At HuffPost, we believe that everyone needs high-quality journalism, but we understand that not everyone can afford to pay for expensive news subscriptions.

The Wall Street Journal reporter was arrested in March while on a reporting trip in Russia. He could face up to 20 years in prison if convicted.","Evan Gershkovich , the U.S. reporter who was arrested in Russia earlier this year on espionage charges, will remain in pre-trial detention until Jan. 30, a Russian court ruled. He appeared in court Thursday wearing a dark sweater,  according to The Moscow Times . Gershkovich, who works for The Wall Street Journal, was  arrested  at the end of March while on a reporting trip in Russia. Advertisement “Evan Gershkovich appeared in a Moscow City court today, where an appeal of the recent extension of his pre-trial detention was denied once again,” the Wall Street Journal said in a statement on Thursday. “While we expected this outcome, it’s important that we appeal these rulings to call out the absurd nature of the charge. Evan has been wrongfully detained for more than 250 days for simply doing his job as a journalist, and any portrayal to the contrary is fiction. Thursday’s court hearing and previous hearings have been held behind closed doors because prosecutors say details of the criminal case are classified. Gershkovich could face up to 20 years in prison if convicted. In September, Gershkovich’s parents visited the journalist and  told CNN that he was “doing really well”  under the circumstances.

Shows like ""Game of Thrones"" and ""Succession"" are measured in their success by how much buzz they generate online. People enjoy checking in with characters in whom they’ve invested time, he says.","Buffy’s bit of banter has been  referenced by other shows  as well, including “Supernatural” and “The Flash.” Advertisement The moment is more than just a wink-and-a-nudge to the show’s time slot, concocted in a boardroom by a bunch of executives. It was a very real ode to the time fans carved out every week, choosing to spend it with Buffy, rather than with other characters jostling for their attention. Watching her story unfold was an intentional journey, like a great, long friendship. If your favorite show releases on Tuesday evenings on Netflix or Max but you can’t catch it, you can simply watch it the next day — or more likely, months later,  when all the episodes are available  and you can lie down and consume them all in one go. In this sense, binge-watching has turned the temporality of TV on its head: Those of us who grew up prior to the streaming era would conform our schedules around television shows, now television shows are available to us when our schedule permits. Sure, you can have a community when something drops — but that level of camaraderie and community is no longer a formal part of the television viewing experience. Bingeing, much like the type of eating it describes, is often something done in solitude, cut off from others. Alamy With such a model, what gets lost is that episodic weekly television often created deep bonds with characters that felt much more real to us. When I was getting ready to end my school year, I knew there was a world-ending battle coming that would put a neat pin on her year, just as my final report card would do for me. But often these limited series don’t exactly say how much time has passed; characters can seemingly age years while, in the span of the show, it’s only been a few days or weeks. There was a routine and familiarity with the way time passed on network TV that feels quaint compared to the way shows are experienced now. This paradigm shift reminds me of a viral Slate article, which consisted of people simply sharing how they used to  spend their evenings  after work. While shows like “Game of Thrones” and “Succession” are measured in their success by how much buzz they generate online, the lesson of their weekly success, whether you measure it in buzz, ratings, or something else, should be that people enjoy checking in with characters in whom they’ve invested time, both hours on a Sunday night and weeks on a calendar. It’s what transforms them from characters that live on screen to characters that live on in our hearts and our minds.

Fake shipping notifications are the top issue, followed by fraudulent products bought online. To avoid losing money, do a gut check with yourself about those deals you spot on the internet.","In a new AARP  survey  of 1,880 U.S. holiday shoppers, 80% of respondents said they’ve encountered holiday fraud, with fake shipping notifications being the top issue (53%), followed by fraudulent products bought through an online ad (38%). But often, you may not know the charity was a scam until it’s too late. Advertisement “A lot of times with charity frauds, victims don’t know that they’re actually a victim,” said Amy Nofziger, the director of victim support for the AARP Fraud Watch Network. “Any good, legitimate charity will take your money today, tomorrow, or the next day,” Nofziger said. “But of course, you either don’t receive the goods and now your payment information is exfiltrated.” To avoid losing money, do a gut check with yourself about those deals you spot on the internet. Nofziger said it’s a red flag if the seller has every size and color available when any other website is sold out of that item. If it’s a seller on Facebook Marketplace, avoid listings that  only list peer-to-peer payment systems  like Venmo, CashApp or Zelle as an option because scammers prefer these untraceable and unretractable forms of payment. Advertisement That’s because scammers are known to tamper with gift cards on display racks and set it up so that  when you register to activate them, the scammer will be notified  and they can spend or transfer the funds before you or your gift recipient can use it. Some scammers impersonate airline customer service agents to get your personal and banking information. Because imposters often make fraudulent airline websites, Nofziger said you should also be wary of clicking airfare links you found via a search engine result and instead should go directly to the airline’s website. And actually, I can offer you a $50 discount if you can get me an Amex [American Express] gift card because we’re running a special with Amex,” Nofziger said as an example. “We’re seeing the injection of malware on merchant checkout pages,” Jabbara said. It also helps to check the seller’s reviews and see if they have had a large number of disputes and chargebacks in the past because that’s a red flag, Jabbara said. “You might get a text message from FedEx or USPS saying that they weren’t able to deliver a package because there was missing information on your account: ‘Just click here to fill the information out, your package will be coming,’” Nofziger said as an example. Beyond avoiding suspiciously misspelled text messages, keep track of what you’re buying to know who delivers your package and when. 10'000 Hours via Getty Images Shipping scams can be incredibly common during the holidays. Your options are more limited if it is with cash or not on a card. “If you’re using a peer-to-peer app or using cash or wire transfer or some of non-card payment method, your recourse is somewhat more limited and undefined,” Jabbara said, noting that whether you get money back will depend on the service’s specific policies, and sometimes “it’s kind of a ‘you’re on your own approach.’” Report the scam to authorities.

Setting clear limits for different holiday spending areas will help you avoid making impulse purchases. Emotional spending can be a big problem around the Holiday season, which tends to bring up childhood memories and a sense of pressure.","The holidays are an exciting time for parties, sweet treats, shiny decor and family gatherings. “Maintaining financial boundaries during the holiday season is crucial for several reasons.” Advertisement Stevens emphasized that it’s important to resist the temptation to overspend so you can avoid accumulating debt, foster healthy relationships, minimize stress and model financial responsibility. “I think it’s important to decide on a holiday budget well in advance of the holiday season ― this can include travel, food and gifting expenses,” said Samantha Gorelick, managing financial planner at  Brunch & Budget . “Some folks save all year long for the holiday season, but if you didn’t prepare that far in advance, decide now on an amount you will spend and try your best to stick with it.” Advertisement Setting clear limits for different holiday spending areas will help you avoid making impulse purchases. Doing so can cause you to derail your long-term savings goals.” Make a list (and check it twice). “Put the amount you are willing to spend next to each item and/or person before you start shopping, and please, please update it in with your actual spending as you go,” said Anne Lester, a retirement savings expert and author of the upcoming book  “Your Best Financial Life.” She emphasized how easy it is to spend beyond your means, particularly in this era of apps and browser extensions that effectively gamify the process of purchasing expensive items and experiences. Advertisement “It’s important to set realistic and effective boundaries that will make you consider if the thing you are about to get for yourself or someone on your list is really something that is needed ― or even truly wanted,” Lester said. “With high rates of inflation, don’t feel shame if your holiday season might look different than years past,” Howard said. “There might be less gifts under the tree, but maybe they’re more meaningful this year ― like a coupon book for your significant other or spending time with your family on a service project. We should all extend a little more grace this holiday season when it comes to spending.” Start new traditions. But the internet and social media have made it all too easy to fall into that trap. “I think one of the reasons that it becomes easy to violate or ignore financial boundaries is because of the value we’ve been taught spending and overspending on gifts means, as it relates to showing care and showing love,” Stevens said. “In other words, we’ve been taught by the media and our peers that spending equals love, when that’s not necessarily true.” Take the time to consider the beliefs and values you developed growing up, and whether you want to carry them into your holiday spending as an adult. Additionally, each of my kids will receive up to three gifts and one of the gifts will be something that can be used on vacation.” Advertisement Avoid emotional spending. “When it comes to setting financial boundaries this holiday season, be hyper-aware of emotional triggers, social pressure, [fear of missing out] and today’s gift-giving culture,” Howard said. “If you are overspending, explore where you learned this behavior and dig for the root issue behind the spending.” Emotional spending can be a big problem around the holiday season, which tends to bring up childhood memories and a sense of pressure to achieve Hallmark-style “perfection.” “If you feel a rush from shopping, understand your purpose of spending,” Howard said. “Protecting yourself from yourself might look like knowing exactly what gifts you’re buying for others, or only shopping online to reduce extra purchases in store.” Prepare to save after the holidays. So, after the holidays, make a conscious effort to spend less than usual for a couple of months to make up for any overspending during the holidays.” Advertisement Think about your future self. “Think about the dreams you are working towards and how the decision of saving that money today instead will help you get there faster, instead of spending it on a portable monitor or a spin scrubber on TikTok Shop, no matter how many coupons they give you!” she said. “I can’t emphasize enough how important it is to think about taking good care of your future self as well as your current self.” Do you have info to share with HuffPost reporters?",2023-11-28 10:45:01,"[0.16469882410678668, 0.4718307652108243, 0.1314998653929961, 0.11281740631385949, 0.8486636816623221]"

Sales create a sense of urgency with buzzy terms like “one day only,” “limited time, “daily deal” and “flash sale” Avoid sale alerts or bricks-and-mortar stores that tempt your spaving impulses.","But other practices are more sneakily harmful ― like “spaving.” “Spaving is the act of spending money to save money,”  Andrea Woroch , a consumer finance and budgeting expert, told HuffPost. “The problem with spaving is that it can trick you into spending more in order to receive a certain savings benefit in return,” said Jacqueline Howard, the head of money wellness at Ally Bank. “Because of the incentive, it’s easy to feel better about adding a few more items to your cart, even if you weren’t planning on making those additional purchases,” Howard explained. Woroch noted that sales create a sense of urgency with buzzy terms like “one day only,” “limited time, “daily deal” and “flash sale” ― making customers feel like they’ll waste a rare opportunity if they don’t pounce. “The reality is, retailers are constantly rolling out new sales, so just because you miss out on a sale today doesn’t mean you can’t get the same item on sale later,” she explained. Many people also feel a sort of high when they score a good deal on an item, regardless of how much they wanted or needed it in the first place. “Even if you get something at a really good sale price, you’re still spending money that could be going towards something more important, like building your savings, paying down debt, investing, etc.,” Woroch said. “A few bucks here and there adds up and can put a huge dent in your overall budget.” Then there’s the fact that sale items often come with limited or nonexistent return policies. Advertisement For some people, spaving leads to credit card debt, which can mean paying interest that far exceeds whatever was saved in the sales deal. Remove the temptation to spave by avoiding sale alerts however possible. “Create a list before you go shopping and stick to it,” Howard suggested. Plus, you can look around your home or closet to see if you already have something like it — because if you do, even another $10 is unnecessary to spend.” She recommended implementing a 24-hour waiting period to confirm that you don’t have the item or something similar, as well as to shop around, compare prices or even look for a refurbished option. Ask yourself, how will you feel about this purchase in three, six or nine months from now?” Westend61 via Getty Images Try to avoid sale alerts or bricks-and-mortar stores that tempt your spaving impulses. “Stay out of stores that have too many deal temptations,” Woroch said. And be on alert whenever you have to shop in person. “Use browser tools that do the deal hunting for you so you don’t get tempted by another sale when looking for a relevant coupon.” She recommended  PriceBlink , which runs an instant price comparison when you’re looking at a product online and presents other sites that are selling the same item for less, as well as  Sidekick  from  CouponCabin . “The time it takes you to fetch your credit card, the urge to buy should pass, helping you avoid an unnecessary purchase.” Advertisement Do a spending audit. “It’s also a good idea to take a look at just how much you’ve spent over the year so far on excess purchases, which can be eye-opening and give you a little fuel to make changes.” She also recommended thinking about the emotions driving your impulse spaving purchases. “Every time you’re tempted to spave, just think about how that money can go towards helping you reach your goal faster.” Advertisement Stop comparing yourself with others. “When we compare our experiences to that of others, we often lose sight of our values and overspend.” You’ve likely heard the expression “keeping up with the Joneses,” which speaks to the social pressure that many people feel to buy things.",2023-11-09 10:45:00,"[0.19030965122998172, 0.1294552947317662, 0.10357155330156265, 0.07855192444021256, 0.9644304494509052]"

Lopez said that managers can also misconstrue Gen Z colleagues not showing up to the office as a lack of team spirit. What Gen Z And Older Generations Can Learn From Each Other Fernandez said that there should be flexibility for remote work and working alone, but said it can also be helpful for Gen Z professionals to know that “you cannot be efficient with people. As logical as we are, we are emotional beings.” Advertisement Even though it can be inefficient, physically showing up at work can increase relationship-building, and it’s “where you learn to manage dysfunctional teammates, where you learn to negotiate or, frankly, even influence others about your idea,” she said. Guevara said that when he advises Gen Z friends who work remotely and alone, he asks them to separate the situations where it’s comfortable to work alone versus where it’s necessary. “If you need music to work, that’s one thing,” he said. In a 2022 Gallup  poll , Gen Z was the demographic most ambivalent and disengaged with the workplace, but it was not because young workers were slacking off and not caring about their jobs. Most reported missing a close connection to their colleagues, manager or employer. When Fernandez teaches university students, she said that she asks for class volunteers to be her internal focus group, so they can tell her what’s working and what’s not in the classroom. “[Gen Z is] going to be the next set of managers,” Fernandez said. “There’s that preconceived notion that ‘Gen Z is lazy, Gen Z doesn’t like working with other people’ that they’ll use to influence how they approach a situation with someone who happens to be Gen Z.” Advertisement Guevara said that he has Gen Z friends who “get talked down to” by others at work, “as if they don’t know what they’re talking about.” “The way that they talk to people is obviously going to have an impact, especially when there’s a huge age difference,” he said.

A ‘lazy girl job’ mindset is all about creating as much freedom and space in your personal life as possible through efficient work days. If you’ve ever felt like screaming into a pillow or lying on your couch after a hard day at work, you might be feeling something known as “ post-work restraint collapse.","And every year, there’s new language to articulate those long-held but often buried feelings. The Lazy Girl Job This year marked a turning point for how younger professionals are setting their work expectations. Instead, there was the rise of “lazy girl jobs.” In a May  TikTok video , Gabrielle Judge ― a content creator who popularized the term ― defined “lazy girl jobs” as positions where you can have “pretty comfortable salaries, and not do that much work and be remote.”   @gabrielle_judge   Career advice for women who don’t know what remote job to apply to. Women are here to collect those pay checks and move on from the work day. #corporatejobs   #jobsearchhacks   #remoteworking   #antihustleculture   #9to5     ♬ original sound - Anti Work Girlboss     As Judge previously  told  HuffPost: “A ‘lazy girl job’ mindset is all about creating as much freedom and space in your personal life as possible through efficient work days, although not everyone will understand.” Advertisement The LGJ’s wide appeal on TikTok speaks to how professionals are redefining success. Voluntelling If you’ve been quote-unquote “volunteered” for an assignment you didn’t ask for, you’ve actually been “voluntold.” It’s a phrase that was  popularized  by the U.S. military to describe situations where somebody is volunteered for a task without getting the opportunity to say “no,” and with implicit pressure to say “yes.” At work, these assignments may not sound exactly like marching orders, but deep down, you know they are. Advertisement A term like “‘hey’ hanging” perfectly describes the anxiety co-workers may be causing with their messages. Advertisement This summer, more tech employees  complained  that they received these “reassignment” orders from employers. “I don’t see it as ever being a good thing for an employee,” Rahbar warned. “If it were to happen to me, the first thing I would do is probably start my job search immediately for something that did suit my skills where I would be a better fit.” 6. Body Doubling If you work best with an accountability buddy, try a work exercise known as “ body doubling .” With this technique, commonly used by professionals with ADHD, you do a task and have another person on Zoom or in person doing a task too. You might already be doing body doubling without knowing it has a name. It can mean working quietly with a friend in a coffee shop, or it can mean having them finish the same task as you at the same time. Either way, try out this hack if you have trouble concentrating or finishing tasks. Post-Work Restraint Collapse If you’ve ever felt like screaming into a pillow or lying on your couch after a hard day at work, you might be feeling something known as “ post-work restraint collapse .” It’s a concept that therapists are using to describe the bone-deep exhaustion caused by draining work days. Post-work restraint collapse can look like “a sense of depletion and having nothing left for other activities, even things that you might really enjoy, like exercise, spending time with your family or other social activities,”  Emily Treichler , a licensed clinical psychologist, previously told HuffPost about post-work restraint collapse.

There are some steps you can take in advance of and during the transit process to feel less on edge. Try to fly on days that are historically less busy as well.","Advertisement “Traveling can be stressful, especially when it comes to air travel,” Katy Nastro, spokesperson for the flight alert service, Going, told HuffPost. “Let’s not forget Mother Nature can wreak havoc in the form of flight disruptions due to winter storms,” Nastro added. “People put such high importance on the holidays being perfect ― getting home to see friends and family, having the perfect gifts, and you’ve put so much effort in, probably a lot of money too ― that when things go wrong, you feel them 10 times more than you probably would at any other time of year,” said  Meg Jerrard  from Solo Female Travelers Tours. Fortunately, there are some steps you can take in advance of and during the transit process to feel less on edge while traveling around this time. “Cancellations and delays snowball throughout the day, so early-morning flights tend to experience fewer interruptions than those later in the day.” Try to fly on days that are historically less busy as well. “Thanksgiving travel went smoothly, but Christmas and New Year’s have greater potential for snow storms,” Dengler said. “Don’t forget essentials like chargers, travel documents and medications in your carry-on if you are checking luggage, and also include an  AirTag in each piece of checked luggage .” Try to fit  everything into a carry-on luggage  to minimize the risk of losing your belongings in transit. “You can decrease these odds by flying straight to your source when possible!” Advertisement Arrive early. Give yourself enough buffer time to deal with the lengthy lines for security checkpoints and bag check counters (if you must). Consider enrolling in expedited security options like  Clear or TSA PreCheck  as well. Advertisement “Keep important documents, like your passport and boarding passes, easily accessible,” Glenn advised. Betsie Van der Meer via Getty Images Don't forget to pack some patience, perspective and positivity. “So your flight is delayed and you’re stuck in an airport for 15 hours? “You can choose to see things as a terrible way to spend the holidays, or as that memory that you and your kids tell for 20 years to come at the Christmas table, that you went on a treasure hunt through an airport on Christmas Eve.” Advertisement Embody the holiday spirit and look for moments of magic ― or create them yourself. “Try traveling solo,” suggested  Radha Vyas , co-founder and CEO of adventure travel company Flash Pack. “While you can do everything right, traveling around the holidays is still stressful. “It’s not about celebrating on an exact date but finding the way to share with your loved ones.” Support HuffPost A No-B.S.

This guidance applies to both checked and carry-on luggage. Craft scissors are only permitted in checked luggage. Snow globes are considered liquids and will be confiscated by TSA agents.,"Flying during the holidays can come with logistical challenges, especially when gifts are involved. Others might be concerned about packing them securely to avoid damage or other mishaps. But is it OK to fly with wrapped presents? We asked a couple of travel experts to share their advice. What To Know About Taking Wrapped Gifts On Flights “Be sure to follow  TSA guidelines  when packing,” said Cheryl Nelson ,  a travel preparedness expert and founder of  Prepare with Cher . “While there aren’t specific gift wrapping restrictions, there is a chance your perfectly wrapped present with the curled bow could be unwrapped by a TSA agent if your luggage is flagged for safety inspection.” Although there aren’t explicit rules that forbid it, TSA advises against wrapping your gifts before packing them in your suitcase since there’s a chance this could get undone in the security screening process. This guidance applies to both checked and carry-on luggage. “Whether a wrapped gift is in a carry-on bag or checked luggage, if your luggage is flagged at TSA, your gift will be unwrapped,” Nelson said. “This could cause delays for you getting through TSA security and delay your checked luggage from making it on time for your scheduled flight departure.” Advertisement What To Do Instead Understandably, you might not want to risk getting delayed or having your beautiful wrapping paper get torn up. But there are ways to be prepared without having everything fully gift-wrapped. “You can keep your gifts in a gift bag or a box, but you’ll want to make sure that they can be easily opened by TSA agents if they need to be inspected,” said Lindsay Schwimer, a consumer travel expert with the trip-booking app  Hopper . Nelson offered some other suggestions for flying with presents as well. Advertisement Other Things To Keep In Mind As you prepare for your holiday flights, remember that everything you pack in your bag is subject to TSA regulations, including gifts. So if you got someone a set of nice hand lotions, make sure they’re carry-on size or put them in your checked bag. “Travelers who are unsure if an item should be packed in a carry-on or checked bag should check the TSA homepage and reference the ‘ What can I bring? Nelson noted that craft scissors are only permitted in checked luggage, so don’t try to toss them in your carry-on with other gift-wrapping supplies. “Chances are that someone at your destination will likely have scissors you can borrow,” she added. “If you plan to pack a festive snow globe in your carry-on luggage, remember that snow globes are considered liquids and anything liquid larger than 3.4 ounces ― roughly the size of a tennis ball ― will be flagged and confiscated by TSA agents,” she said. “If you plan to gift a snow globe, please carefully wrap it in bubble wrap for protection in your checked luggage.” And remember: If you are flying this holiday season, be sure to take all the  proper precautions  to help reduce the spread of COVID-19.

As we learned from our   exploration into Uggs , shoes that are too roomy can cause issues because they force you to overuse the muscles and tendons in your feet. “Consistently wearing this style of shoe over time can increase your risk of developing bunions.” In general, a tapered toe box, which is common in fashion boots, should be avoided when looking for boots that are good for foot health, added  Dr. Advertisement Instead, look for “a toe box that fits the shape of your foot,” Tarr advised. “High heels, especially those exceeding a comfortable height, can strain the feet and contribute to issues like ball-of-foot pain,” Fox noted. The soft fabric can be especially beneficial for people who have “bony enlargements” in their feet, he said. Using the wrong type of footwear for an activity may lead to discomfort, pain, or even injuries,” Fox said. If you’re trekking on more rugged terrain, make sure your footwear is up for the challenge.

Dance heels are designed to look good and Repetto ,  Capezio ,  Vamp,   Aida Dance ,  Very Fine ,  Burju  and  Vivaz are among them.","I’ve been looking forward to reuniting with family and friends at weddings long-postponed by the pandemic. Advertisement During another online shopping expedition to find somewhat-bearable-yet-aesthetically-pleasing shoes, I came across  two   TikTok videos   suggesting a heel I had overlooked — the dance heel. Many  ballroom, latin and heels (a dance style performed while wearing high-heeled shoes — think Beyoncé’s  “Single Ladies” ) dancers  perform complicated, physically intense dance routines while wearing heels (even stilettos). So, if dance heels can give dancers the comfort and support they need to practice and perform, can’t the everyday heels-wearer also benefit from them? Depending on the shape of your foot though, that may be true. “Some women have feet that are narrower [in the front] and it’s easier for them to wear high heels. Although regular heels’ function is primarily aesthetic, dance heels are designed to look good and Repetto ,  Capezio ,  Vamp,   Aida Dance ,  Very Fine ,  Burju  and  Vivaz.

So, she  knows the difference between regular and dance heels all too well. “They’re trying to design their equipment — in this case, their shoes — to be as functional and efficient as possible so they can perform at the highest level.” For Baramo, her specialized Burju shoes help her do just that. I’d say we had our shoes on for about five hours. Whether or not you want to invest in dance heels boils down to your aesthetic, desired comfort level and how well your feet can tolerate heels. But certainly, it’s going to be more comfortable than wearing your traditional stiletto.” My hopes were high. Unfortunately, my feet still were throbbing after a night on the dance floor.
