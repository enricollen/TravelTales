At the end of the game, the mascot was lowered into what appeared to be a giant toaster. The bottom of the toaster apparatus opened up and spit out a version of the mascot made out of edible Pop Tart material.","College football got a little weirder than usual on Thursday during the Pop-Tart Bowl ― an annual December game that’s undergone numerous name changes over the past three decades. This year’s game,  in which Kansas State beat North Carolina State  28-19, involved a bug-eyed, human-sized Pop Tart mascot. Advertisement At the end of the game, the mascot brandished a sign reading, “DREAMS REALLY DO COME TRUE” before being lowered into what appeared to be a giant toaster. Donna Summer’s “Hot Stuff” blared in the background. The bottom of the toaster apparatus opened up and spit out a version of the mascot (with no human actor inside ― we hope) made out of edible Pop-Tart material. Kansas State players grabbed at the anthropomorphic Pop-Tart’s body and shoved bits of him into their mouths in a celebratory fashion. And some people highlighted the gruesome, jammy aftermath. Advertisement But don’t feel bad for the Pop-Tart. Reporter Rodger Sherman  confirmed with the mascot  prior to its toasty demise that the breakfast pastry indeed yearned to be eaten.

Lauren Boebert ’s (R-Colo.)  decision to change  to a less competitive congressional district. “From a party perspective, we certainly don’t think it was the best move,” Dave Williams told  CNN ’s  Brianna Keilar  on Thursday. “We felt that she was best suited for Congressional District 3 and that she was in the best position to win reelection and retain that for Republicans.” Advertisement He said the lawmaker has “a serious challenge on her hands trying to explain to the voters of CD 4 why she thought it was necessary to leave CD 3 and have a better chance at keeping her seat in Congress.” He added, “It’s kind of a problematic proposition, but it’s again, it’s something for the voters to decide.” Boebert announced Wednesday she was entering the GOP primary for retiring Rep. Ken Buck’s seat in the state’s east, leaving the district she won by a hair last year. She said it would be a “fresh start” because it has been a “pretty difficult year for me and my family.” The move allows her to skirt a likely rematch against Democrat Adam Frisch, whose campaign has significantly outraised Boebert’s.

Christie says Haley's Civil War remarks show she lacks backbone to lead the country. Haley walked it back on Thursday morning, telling a New Hampshire radio station, “of course the Civil War was about slavery. We know that.”","Chris Christie  criticized his fellow Republican presidential hopeful  Nikki Haley  on Thursday over her  failure to say slavery  was the cause of the American Civil War, claiming she did so because “she’s unwilling to offend anyone by telling the truth.” “She’s smart and she knows better. I know her well, and I don’t believe Nikki has a racist bone in her body,” the former New Jersey governor said at a town hall event in Epping, New Hampshire. Advertisement “The reason she did it is just as bad, if not worse, and should make everybody concerned about her candidacy,” he continued. “She did it because she’s unwilling to offend anyone by telling the truth.” Christie suggested the incident demonstrates that Haley lacks backbone to lead the country and stand up against tough foreign leaders,  Democrats , and certain divisive  Republicans , accusing her of being “afraid to say that  Donald Trump  is unfit because she’s afraid of offending people who support Donald Trump.” Unlike most of his rivals, Christie has been vocally critical of the former president, who faces 91 felony counts across four indictments. Advertisement At a Wednesday night campaign stop in Berlin, New Hampshire, a voter asked Haley to state the cause of the Civil War. Haley cited the role of government, and “freedoms,” but declined to mention slavery. Facing fierce backlash, Haley walked it back on Thursday morning, telling a New Hampshire radio station, “of course the Civil War was about slavery. We know that.” She also declined, when asked by a voter on Thursday, to explicitly rule out  being Trump’s vice president , and said she  would pardon  the former president if she wins the election and if he’s convicted of a crime. “Since she won’t deny it, we have to believe that she’s willing to do it,” Christie said of Haley’s aspirations for a potential second Trump administration. Some of Haley’s other rivals have also criticized her viral Civil War remarks. Ron DeSantis told reporters,  according to the Des Moines Register . Advertisement Vivek Ramaswamy, with whom Haley has  clashed  repeatedly on foreign policy,  tweeted : “Turns out Nikki knows as little about the Civil War as she does about the Ukraine War.” Haley has seen a polling bump recently, including a surge in New Hampshire, but she still lags Trump, who leads the pack by a wide margin nationally.

Mr Marriott's death was ""tragic"" and the ""thoughts and prayers"" of church members were with his family, they added.

More than 160 people were injured as Russia hit Kyiv, Odesa, Dnipropetrovsk, Kharkiv and Lviv in the early hours of Friday morning. Russia ""used nearly every type of weapon in its arsenal"", with homes and a maternity hospital hit, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said. Ukraine's air force said it had never seen so many missiles launched at once. Kyiv's air defences have drastically improved in recent months, but on Friday they were overwhelmed. An Air Force spokesperson said Russia used hypersonic, cruise and ballistic missiles, including X-22 type, which are difficult to intercept. The air force said 114 of 158 missiles and drones had been shot down. For months, mostly falling debris caused the damage and loss of life that Ukrainians constantly fear. Once again, it wasn't just Kyiv picking up the pieces either. Authorities claimed more than 10 Iranian-made Shahed drones and 15 missiles targeted the western city of Lviv, somewhere which has often been spared the worst of this invasion. Kharkiv mayor Igor Terekhov said three people were killed and 13 were injured in a series of strikes on the city which damaged a hospital and residential buildings. The governor of Dnipropetrovsk region said that six people were killed and 28 were injured in what he called a ""tragic morning for the region"". One Russian missile even briefly entered Polish airspace as it homed in on its Ukrainian target. Its missile stockpiles aren't what they were, but Moscow has shown it still wants to continue its tactic of suppressing Ukraine's population, in the hope that not feeling safe will lessen their appetite for this war. It's also been a week when Ukraine destroyed a major Russian landing ship in occupied Crimea, and the US delivered the last of its approved military packages to Ukraine worth $250m. Responding to the latest Russian bombardment, US President Joe Biden described it as ""a stark reminder to the world that, after nearly two years of this devastating war, Putin's objective remains unchanged. Maybe the renewed missile attack was revenge, or another statement? A spokesman for Russia's Defence Ministry simply said ""all the designated military targets have been hit"".

So what does it mean for next year's general election? Colorado's highest court issued a similar, unprecedented, ruling just days earlier. But it is still uncertain whether Mr Trump's name will appear on the ballot when the two states pick their Republican candidate in the coming months, as both rulings are on hold while an appeals process plays out. Section 3 disqualifies people who engage in ""insurrection or rebellion"" from holding federal office. Her order said Mr Trump ""over the course of several months and culminating on January 6 2021, used a false narrative of election fraud to inflame his supporters and direct them to the Capitol"". Ms Bellows, an elected official, was accused of making a politically motivated decision by the Trump campaign. On 19 December,  the Colorado Supreme Court said  it found ""clear and convincing evidence that President Trump engaged in insurrection"". It was the first time Section 3 had been used to disqualify a presidential candidate. They also noted that Mr Trump has not been charged with inciting insurrection. These rulings only apply to Colorado and Maine respectively. Hours after Maine's ruling, California's elected secretary of state, a Democrat, ignored calls to remove Mr Trump from the state's Republican primary ballot - saying it was a matter for the courts. In both Colorado and Maine, Joe Biden won against Donald Trump in 2020 by a wide margin, and it is unlikely that Mr Trump will need to win the states to enter the White House once more. Any decision by the US Supreme Court could supersede this and apply nationally. The balance of that court has shifted to more conservative in recent years, thanks in part to three justices who were appointed by Mr Trump when he was president. The Colorado Supreme Court disagreed, and top legal scholars are divided on whether this law should apply to Mr Trump. Lawyers for Mr Trump dispute that he engaged in insurrection and argue his remarks to supporters on the day of the 2021 riot were protected by his right to free speech. But there could be wider implications for the general election. Dozens of other US states have similar lawsuits trying to bar Mr Trump from running, and the decisions in Colorado and Maine could make it more likely some of them succeed. If Mr Trump was stopped from running in a state where he and Mr Biden are neck-and-neck, that could be critical in a presidential race that is expected to be closely fought.",2023-12-29 14:33:30,"[0.11186714605195681, 0.09556231207458032, 0.980654614459517, 0.09255421388132863, 0.09002127957997569]",,Can-Donald-Trump-still-run-for-president-after-Maine-and-Colorado-rulings?.wav

It is not clear yet whether the death was caused by food. Officials say investigations are continuing into any common links between cases and the recalled cheeses.

Symptoms of STEC infection can vary in severity, ranging from mild diarrhoea to severe abdominal cramps, vomiting and bloody diarrhoea. In up to 15% of cases, infection can lead to the development of haemolytic uraemic syndrome (HUS) - a serious and life-threatening condition predominantly affecting the kidneys, which can result in death.

And there is no better example of that old adage than Blackpool Tower and the fire that never was. On Thursday, six fire engines, a drone team and a rope-rescue team gathered at the famous landmark tower built more than 100 years ago. Social media videos were rapidly notching up views. That was until police flying over the tower in a helicopter  declared ""there is no fire"". The flames, it turned out, were in fact orange netting flapping about in the wind, leaving some red faces and quite possibly a mini-surge in opticians' bookings.

'Ritual mass murder'  The yoga room was dark and lit with candles One September night this year, two dog walkers peered through a window into a dark cafe to see bodies lying on the ground covered with blankets surrounded by candles and a mysterious person in a robe walking between them.

Instructor Millie Laws later said: ""I guess from the outside view it could look like that [a mass murder], because they're all really still, very nice and relaxed.

Such was the concern over the escaped white tiger, play stopped at a cricket ground and animal specialists at nearby Marwell Zoo were prepared to send in a team with tranquiliser darts. But when the helicopter arrived and blew over the tiger, it became quickly clear  it was just a stuffed toy . The ""bone-chilling"" discovery was reported to police Earlier this year, a concerned member of the public called the police after finding what they thought was a pile of human bones in a bush in their Derbyshire garden.

Mr Shapps branded the wave of attacks - which Ukraine's military said comprised 158 missiles and drones targeting a number of cities simultaneously - ""murderous"". He suggested they were ""a desperate and futile attempt to regain momentum after the catastrophic loss of hundreds of thousands of conscripts and ahead of the humiliation of his three-day war entering a third calendar year."" The defence secretary said the package would restock UK-gifted air defence systems capable of striking down Russian drones and missiles with ""incredible accuracy"". The delivery is intended to protect civilians and infrastructure from drones and bombing. The Ministry of Defence (MoD) said the UK has now supplied a squadron of battle-ready Challenger 2 tanks, three batteries of self-propelled AS90 guns, hundreds of armoured and protected vehicles, as well as long-range precision strike capability in the form of Storm Shadow cruise missiles and long-range attack drones. But the announcement comes as questions are being asked about whether Western support for Ukraine is wavering after nearly three years of war there and a new conflict in the Middle East. The  latest tranche of US support was approved this week , but further packages will need fresh approval from Congress. There has also been disagreement among European countries about aid for Ukraine, with  Hungary blocking a £43bn (€50bn) EU aid package earlier this month . Mr Shapps added: ""Putin is testing Ukraine's defences and the West's resolve, hoping that he can clutch victory from the jaws of defeat. But he is wrong. ""Ukraine's degradation of the Russian Black Sea fleet has proven it is still in this fight to win. And today's air defence package sends an undeniable message, in the face of Russian barbarity that the UK remains absolutely committed to supporting Ukraine."" He called on the West ""to come together and redouble our efforts to get Ukraine what they need to win"". Earlier, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak posted on social media that the attacks showed  Russian President Vladimir Putin would ""stop at nothing to achieve his aim of eradicating freedom and democracy"". He said the UK would ""not let him win"" and called for the country to ""stand with Ukraine - for as long as it takes"".

It asks the court to order Israel to halt its attacks. Israel swiftly rejected the filing “with disgust.” South Africa has been a fierce critic of Israel’s military campaign.,"THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) — South Africa launched a case Friday at the United Nations’ top court accusing Israel of genocide against Palestinians in Gaza and asking the court to order Israel to halt its attacks. Israel swiftly rejected the filing “with disgust.” South Africa’s submission to the International Court of Justice alleges that “acts and omissions by Israel ... are genocidal in character” as they are committed with the intent “to destroy Palestinians in Gaza” as a part of the broader Palestinian national, racial and ethnic group. Advertisement It also asks the Hague-based court to issue an interim order for Israel to immediately suspend its military operations in Gaza. A hearing into that request is likely in the coming days or weeks. The case, if it goes ahead, will take years. Israel also accused South Africa of cooperating with Hamas, the militant group whose Oct. 7 cross-border attack in southern Israel triggered the ongoing war in Gaza. The statement also said Israel is committed to and operates according to international law and focuses its military actions solely against Hamas, adding that the residents of Gaza are not an enemy. Whether it will succeed in halting the war remains to be seen. In March 2022, the court ordered  Russia to halt hostilities  in Ukraine, a binding legal ruling that Moscow flouted as it pressed ahead with its devastating attacks on Ukrainian towns and cities. South Africa has been a fierce critic of Israel’s military campaign in Gaza. Many  including President Cyril Ramaphosa  have compared Israel’s policies in Gaza and the West Bank with South Africa’s past apartheid regime of racial segregation. Ramaphosa has accused Israel of war crimes and acts “tantamount to genocide.” Support HuffPost The Stakes Have Never Been Higher At HuffPost, we believe that everyone needs high-quality journalism, but we understand that not everyone can afford to pay for expensive news subscriptions.

South Australia Premier Peter Malinauskas expressed concern about the recent frequency of attacks in his state. “We’ve seen 11 fatal shark attacks in South Australia since the year 2000, so the fact we’ve seen three across this summer is startling and it is of concern,” he  told Australia’s Channel 9  on Friday.

The alert coincided with what Ukraine has called Russia's biggest day of air strikes since its war began.,"1 hour ago About sharing A missile believed to have been fired by Ukraine landed in Poland in November 2022, killing two people By Adam Easton BBC News, Warsaw Poland's armed forces chief believes a Russian missile entered Poland for almost three minutes and then turned back into Ukrainian airspace. Gen Wieslaw Kukula said the missile travelled about 40km (25 miles) into Polish airspace early on Friday. The alert coincided with what Ukraine has called Russia's biggest day of air strikes since its war began. President Andrzej Duda convened an emergency security meeting after the object was picked up on radar. Poland is a member of the Nato alliance, and Polish and Allied aircraft were scrambled in response to the incident at around 07:00 (06:00 GMT) on Friday. Operational Command spokesman Lt Col Jacek Goryszewski said an unidentified object had entered Poland from Ukraine near the town of Zamosc, in the Lublin region of south-eastern Poland, not far from the border. He told private broadcaster TVN24 the event may be linked with Russia's missile and drone attack against some of Ukraine's biggest cities. At least 30 people were killed in the attacks which targeted Lviv, the closest Ukrainian city to Lublin region, as well as Dnipro, Kyiv and other cities. Nato Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said  the alliance stood in solidarity with Poland  and ""remains vigilant"". An unconfirmed report said a search was taking place near the town of Hrubieszow. The Polish government has not ruled out Russian provocation. We should check both scenarios carefully,"" Deputy Defence Minister Stanislaw Wziatek told TVN24. Since Russia's invasion and war against Ukraine three missiles have entered Poland. In November 2022, two Polish farmers were killed by a missile that landed in the village of Przewodow near the Ukrainian border. In a harmless but more embarrassing incident from December last year, an object believed to have been an unarmed Russian Kh-55 cruise missile was fired from Belarus and crossed around 500km of Polish territory before landing in a forest. The object, which was detected by Polish air defences at the time, was only found in April this year by a passer-by not far from the city of Bydgoszcz in central Poland. Another unidentified object that entered Polish airspace this year from the direction of Belarus was probably an observation balloon. Radar contact with it was lost near Rypin in central Poland. Both sides of Poland's political arena have seized on the latest event to score points. His predecessor, Mariusz Blaszczak, from the right-wing Law and Justice-led government that lost power in an election in October and served as defence minister during the two earlier events, responded: ""We don't know what fell in the area of Tomaszow Lubelski.",2023-12-29 17:48:54,"[0.29521146163400735, 0.12488790613214037, 0.9221347619711745, 0.15131242094484945, 0.15500076081754166]",,Poland-says-Russian-missile-entered-airspace-then-went-into-Ukraine.wav

The ITC, a federal agency, ordered the halt in October to block Apple from using specific technologies underpinning a blood-oxygen measurement system in its Series 9 and Ultra 2 watches. Apple has been embroiled in an intellectual property dispute with the medical technology company Masimo over those technologies. The court’s action will allow sales of the two Apple Watch models pending its decision on whether to also permit sales as it weighs Apple’s appeal. The two watch models will be available at Apple’s online store by noon Pacific Time on Thursday, according to the company. They will return to some Apple stores Wednesday, with wider availability expected by Saturday. That dispute hasn’t directly affected Apple Watch sales yet because another regulatory body had ruled that AliveCor’s technology isn’t patentable. The legal tussle on that issue is still ongoing. The patent headaches facing Apple as it tries to infuse more medical technology into its watch models make it increasingly likely the company will either have to start working out licensing deals or simply acquiring startups specializing in the field, Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives predicted.

In a  complaint  filed Tuesday, officials argued that the company should be forced to offer reinstatement and back pay to Stephen Andrade, a nearly 18-year Trader Joe’s veteran in Massachusetts. Andrade lost his job making store signs in June after a manager accused him of leaving a power saw in the back of the store after being told to remove it. Advertisement Both Andrade and the union  previously told HuffPost  they believed his firing was retaliatory. The complaint says Trader Joe’s should have to send Andrade a letter “apologizing for any hardship or distress caused by his discharge.” In a phone interview, Andrade, 46, said he was pleased to see that prosecutors found merit in his story. “I hope that the union can keep chalking up some wins and we can hold the company accountable for their practices and trying to union-bust,” Andrade said. But I know that’s not how capitalism works these days.” The complaint also states that Trader Joe’s retaliated against union workers in Massachusetts and Minnesota by providing them with lesser 401(k) contributions than non-union workers. Officials say the move was intended to “discourage employees from engaging” in their protected rights. Trader Joe’s, which is based in Monrovia, California, did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Wednesday. Those earlier charges are all part of the new complaint that was issued Tuesday. Stephen Andrade, who worked nearly 18 years for Trader Joe's, was fired by the company in June.

Fighting along the front line is largely bogged down by winter weather after  Ukraine’s summer counteroffensive  failed to make a significant breakthrough along the roughly 1,000-kilometer (620-mile) line of contact.

Most crowded onto streets around the town’s main hospital, Al-Aqsa Martyrs, hoping it would be safer from Israeli strikes. Those areas continue to be hit by Israeli strikes that regularly crush homes full of people. Israel has said its campaign in Gaza is likely to last for months, vowing to dismantle Hamas across the territory and prevent a repeat of  its Oct. 7 attack  into southern Israel. Benny Gantz, a member of the country’s three-man War Cabinet, said the fighting ”will be expanded, according to need, to additional centers and additional fronts.” He and other Israeli officials also threatened greater military action against Lebanon’s Hezbollah, hiking fears of an all-out war on that front. Israeli Foreign Minister Eli Cohen warned Wednesday that “all options are on the table” if Hezbollah does not withdraw from the border area, as called for under a 2006 U.N. cease-fire. Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah “must understand that he’s next,” Cohen said. More than 21,100 Palestinians , most of them women and children, have been killed, according to the Health Ministry in Hamas-ruled Gaza.

We haven’t seen such bombing since the start of the war,” said Rami Abu Mosab, speaking from Bureij, where he has sheltered since fleeing his home in northern Gaza. Most civilians are taking refuge here from Bureij camp with their belongings following an evacuation order, as battles are ongoing between Israel and the Palestinian militant group Hamas. This was the third move further south for Ibrahim al-Zatari, a daily laborer. On Wednesday morning, they made an hourslong journey on foot to Deir al-Balah, where — like many others — they wandered the streets looking for an empty spot to lie down. “Where should we go?” With much of northern Gaza leveled, Palestinians fear a similar fate awaits other areas, including Khan Younis, where Israeli forces launched ground operations in early December. Health Ministry spokesman Ashraf al-Qidra said at least 20 people were killed and dozens more wounded. Before troops move in, heavy bombardment targets what Israel says is Hamas’ tunnels and military infrastructure. Israel has said Hamas must be destroyed after its  its Oct. 7 attack  in which militants broke through Israel’s formidable defenses and killed some 1,200 people — mostly civilians — and abducted around 240.

Three men, aged 48, 59 and 69, were killed after a boat with 11 people on board capsized in rough weather in Moreton Bay off the south Queensland coast on Tuesday, police said. Ambulances took eight survivors to a hospital in stable conditions. Queensland Police Acting Chief Superintendent Andrew Pilotto said those rescued were lucky to survive. “The storm was still raging when they were rescued,"" Pilotto said. ""It would have been very difficult to survive in those conditions anywhere.” Elsewhere, a 59-year-old woman was killed by a falling tree in the Queensland city of Gold Coast on Monday night. The body of a 9-year-old girl was found on Tuesday in the neighboring city of Brisbane hours after she disappeared in a flooded stormwater drain. They were among three women swept into the flooded river through a stormwater drain on Tuesday. Queensland Police Commissioner Katarina Carroll blamed “extraordinarily difficult weather” for the tragedies. “It has been a very tragic 24 hours due to the weather,” Carroll told reporters. Severe weather has lashed parts of southeast Australia since Monday including Queensland and Victoria. A woman, who is yet to be identified, was found dead late Tuesday after flash flooding receded at a campground in Buchan in regional Victoria. Also on Tuesday, a 44-year-old man was killed by a falling branch on his rural property in Caringal in eastern Victoria.

The statement arrives less than two weeks after Ye went on an antisemitic rant in Las Vegas. He also once suggested slavery was a choice and called the coronavirus vaccine “the mark of the beast.,"The  rapper formerly known as Kanye West,  who has a long history of making antisemitic comments, apologized to the Jewish community in an Instagram post written in Hebrew on Tuesday. “I sincerely apologize to the Jewish community for any unintended outburst caused by my words or actions,” Ye wrote. Advertisement “It was not my intention to offend or demean, and I deeply regret any pain I may have caused,” continued the rapper, who  legally changed his name to Ye in 2021. The statement arrives less than two weeks after Ye went on an antisemitic rant in Las Vegas while promoting his upcoming album “Vultures,” due out Jan. 12. “After causing untold damage by using his vast influence and platform to poison countless minds with vicious antisemitism and hate, an apology in Hebrew may be the first step on a long journey towards making amends to the Jewish community and all those who he has hurt,” the Anti-Defamation League said in a statement to The Associated Press and other news outlets on Tuesday. “Ultimately, actions will speak louder than words but this initial act of contrition is welcome.” The American Jewish Committee, however, criticized Ye’s use of Hebrew in the apology. “To be sure, using Hebrew to communicate with the Jewish community intentionally denies most American Jews— and, consequently, non-Jews—the ability to directly see Kanye’s apology.” Advertisement “While he claims that he is committed to learning and greater understanding, this apology speaks to ‘any pain I may have caused,’ rather than acknowledging the pain that he has caused,” the AJC continued. He also once suggested slavery was a choice and called the coronavirus vaccine “the mark of the beast.” In October 2022, he was criticized for wearing a “White Lives Matter” T-shirt at  his Paris Fashion Week show  and tweeted that he was going to go “death con 3 on JEWISH PEOPLE,” an apparent reference to the U.S. defense readiness condition scale, DEFCON. Later that month, the  Balenciaga fashion house cut ties  with Ye and he  lost the lucrative partnership with Adidas  that helped catapult him to billionaire status over his remarks. Adidas has sold hundreds of millions of euros  in remaining Yeezy shoes,  donating part of the profits to groups like the Anti-Defamation League and the Philonise & Keeta Floyd Institute for Social Change. (Recently, though,  Adidas CEO Bjørn Gulden said on a podcast episode  that he didn’t think Ye “meant what he said and I don’t think he’s a bad person.” Gulden  later apologized,  the Anti-Defamation League said.) He was  locked out of his accounts on Instagram and what was then known as Twitter,  though he has since returned to both platforms. But less than two months later, he told  conspiracy theorist and host Alex Jones  that he sees “good things about Hitler.” “We’ve seen this behavior from Kanye before — the antisemitic rant and the follow-up apology,” the American Jewish Committee said. Ye’s latest apology ends with him saying he’s committed to “learning from this experience” and plans on “making amends.” A representative for Ye did not immediately respond to the AP’s request for further comment.

Literally Media, which owns Know Your Meme, Cracked and other brands, acquired Mel for an undisclosed amount. Originally a content site for the Dollar Shave Club, Mel was once  “the rare men’s magazine.”","Men are so back: Mel magazine, an audacious digital media site for the guys, will get a new lease on life next year after its unceremonious dissolution in 2022. Literally Media, which owns Know Your Meme, Cracked and other brands, announced Friday that it acquired Mel magazine for an undisclosed amount. Originally a content site for the Dollar Shave Club, Mel was  once  “the rare men’s magazine that has taken upon itself to investigate masculinity, not enforce it.” Advertisement Oren Katzeff, CEO of Literally Media, told HuffPost that he wanted to acquire Mel for its unique voice and a loyal audience. When you make an acquisition like this, you have to be very respectful of that while also thinking about how to expand and grow the voice into the next chapter of the brand.” Mel doesn’t have an editor-in-chief or any writers yet, but the magazine will start publishing next year. Katzeff said he would like to have three to five people on staff with a mix of full-time and freelance employees and then “grow from there.” Katzeff said he plans to package Mel “with opportunities beyond the articles on site,” which will include a newsletter strategy as well as introducing video, which will open “more doors” to brand deals. Advertisement “There’s really a ripe opportunity for Mel to expand beyond just the website into at the very least video and possibly audio as well,” Katzeff said. “Literally Media as a company years ago was probably doing anywhere from 10 to 15 million video views a month, and now we’re doing in the hundreds of millions. So I’m pretty bullish in terms of Mel’s opportunity in both the video and audio space moving forward.” Mel magazine’s stories included headlines like  “Our Eternal Horniness for the Camp Counselor”  and  “I Tried Mark Wahlberg’s Catholic App to See If It Could Reconnect Me With God.”  Mel magazine reached 4 million unique monthly visitors during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, according to a news release, but in  March 2021, it ceased publication . A few months later, Recurrent Ventures acquired it only to pull the plug in 2022  and lay off all staff members . Mel magazine is the most recent digital media outlet Paste magazine acquired Jezebel , the women’s publication, after it shuttered in November. Katzeff said it’s “more challenging that ever” to run a successful media company. “I think we’ll be seeing more opportunities like these, I think we’ll be seeing more collaborations moving forward,” he said. “And, you know, what I hope with an acquisition like this is that we can also leverage some of the success we’ve had with our other brands to help revive some of the audience on Mel. “I think the power of a network is something that you get to enjoy that you don’t necessarily get as an independent entity. And so, my guess would be as we go into 2024, if the market conditions continue as they are, which is, again, greater challenges in terms of audience, greater challenges in terms of monetization, I think we may see more and more opportunities like these.” Advertisement Support HuffPost The Stakes Have Never Been Higher At HuffPost, we believe that everyone needs high-quality journalism, but we understand that not everyone can afford to pay for expensive news subscriptions.

In an exchange about holiday plans with colleague Alexa Maslowski, Bruck said: “The extent of my traveling is probably going to visit my girlfriend in Cleveland and that’s about it.” Advertisement “Girlfriend” carried heavy freight for the multimedia journalist. “I said “girlfriend” on air for the first time today, which some people may say “ok, who cares?” … but to me it’s a step toward accepting and loving myself fully and being authentic on and off the air,” she wrote alongside the clip on Instagram last month. Bruck  told People  on Monday that her decision was “spur of the moment” and it’s had lasting consequences. “Messages are pouring in from all around the world, including Ghana, Germany, Australia, London, as well as many states across the U.S.,” Bruck said. “People are telling me how much this visibility means to them and that they’re so proud of me.” Advertisement Bruck said she has been open about her sexuality on social media but an on-air acknowledgment was the icing on the cake. “When I finally said it out loud, I smiled inside because it was a big moment for me,” she said to People. Bruck might have undersold her holiday plans, though. It looks like she and girlfriend Lauren Lanzaretta are doing up the season in epic fashion.

Project Veritas did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Project Veritas is known for its heavily edited videos, like a video targeting  Planned Parenthood  in 2008, where O’Keefe and Lila Rose, the founder of an anti-abortion group,  illegally recorded Planned Parenthood employees consulting Rose, who they believed to be a 13-year-old pregnant girl . Giles and O’Keefe worked together in 2009 on a hidden-video “sting” that purportedly showed employees of the progressive  Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now  (ACORN) agreeing to aid the pair in crimes. The two, who had been employed by conservative journalist Andrew Breitbart, ended up paying settlements to one of the ACORN staffers. The organization, however, lost much of its funding despite investigations that found no wrongdoing.

Shows like ""Game of Thrones"" and ""Succession"" are measured in their success by how much buzz they generate online. People enjoy checking in with characters in whom they’ve invested time, he says.","Buffy’s bit of banter has been  referenced by other shows  as well, including “Supernatural” and “The Flash.” Advertisement The moment is more than just a wink-and-a-nudge to the show’s time slot, concocted in a boardroom by a bunch of executives. It was a very real ode to the time fans carved out every week, choosing to spend it with Buffy, rather than with other characters jostling for their attention. Watching her story unfold was an intentional journey, like a great, long friendship. If your favorite show releases on Tuesday evenings on Netflix or Max but you can’t catch it, you can simply watch it the next day — or more likely, months later,  when all the episodes are available  and you can lie down and consume them all in one go. In this sense, binge-watching has turned the temporality of TV on its head: Those of us who grew up prior to the streaming era would conform our schedules around television shows, now television shows are available to us when our schedule permits. Sure, you can have a community when something drops — but that level of camaraderie and community is no longer a formal part of the television viewing experience. Bingeing, much like the type of eating it describes, is often something done in solitude, cut off from others. Alamy With such a model, what gets lost is that episodic weekly television often created deep bonds with characters that felt much more real to us. When I was getting ready to end my school year, I knew there was a world-ending battle coming that would put a neat pin on her year, just as my final report card would do for me. But often these limited series don’t exactly say how much time has passed; characters can seemingly age years while, in the span of the show, it’s only been a few days or weeks. There was a routine and familiarity with the way time passed on network TV that feels quaint compared to the way shows are experienced now. This paradigm shift reminds me of a viral Slate article, which consisted of people simply sharing how they used to  spend their evenings  after work. While shows like “Game of Thrones” and “Succession” are measured in their success by how much buzz they generate online, the lesson of their weekly success, whether you measure it in buzz, ratings, or something else, should be that people enjoy checking in with characters in whom they’ve invested time, both hours on a Sunday night and weeks on a calendar. It’s what transforms them from characters that live on screen to characters that live on in our hearts and our minds.

Fake shipping notifications are the top issue, followed by fraudulent products bought online. To avoid losing money, do a gut check with yourself about those deals you spot on the internet.","In a new AARP  survey  of 1,880 U.S. holiday shoppers, 80% of respondents said they’ve encountered holiday fraud, with fake shipping notifications being the top issue (53%), followed by fraudulent products bought through an online ad (38%). But often, you may not know the charity was a scam until it’s too late. Advertisement “A lot of times with charity frauds, victims don’t know that they’re actually a victim,” said Amy Nofziger, the director of victim support for the AARP Fraud Watch Network. “Any good, legitimate charity will take your money today, tomorrow, or the next day,” Nofziger said. “But of course, you either don’t receive the goods and now your payment information is exfiltrated.” To avoid losing money, do a gut check with yourself about those deals you spot on the internet. Nofziger said it’s a red flag if the seller has every size and color available when any other website is sold out of that item. If it’s a seller on Facebook Marketplace, avoid listings that  only list peer-to-peer payment systems  like Venmo, CashApp or Zelle as an option because scammers prefer these untraceable and unretractable forms of payment. Advertisement That’s because scammers are known to tamper with gift cards on display racks and set it up so that  when you register to activate them, the scammer will be notified  and they can spend or transfer the funds before you or your gift recipient can use it. Some scammers impersonate airline customer service agents to get your personal and banking information. Because imposters often make fraudulent airline websites, Nofziger said you should also be wary of clicking airfare links you found via a search engine result and instead should go directly to the airline’s website. And actually, I can offer you a $50 discount if you can get me an Amex [American Express] gift card because we’re running a special with Amex,” Nofziger said as an example. “We’re seeing the injection of malware on merchant checkout pages,” Jabbara said. It also helps to check the seller’s reviews and see if they have had a large number of disputes and chargebacks in the past because that’s a red flag, Jabbara said. “You might get a text message from FedEx or USPS saying that they weren’t able to deliver a package because there was missing information on your account: ‘Just click here to fill the information out, your package will be coming,’” Nofziger said as an example. Beyond avoiding suspiciously misspelled text messages, keep track of what you’re buying to know who delivers your package and when. 10'000 Hours via Getty Images Shipping scams can be incredibly common during the holidays. Your options are more limited if it is with cash or not on a card. “If you’re using a peer-to-peer app or using cash or wire transfer or some of non-card payment method, your recourse is somewhat more limited and undefined,” Jabbara said, noting that whether you get money back will depend on the service’s specific policies, and sometimes “it’s kind of a ‘you’re on your own approach.’” Report the scam to authorities.

Setting clear limits for different holiday spending areas will help you avoid making impulse purchases. Emotional spending can be a big problem around the Holiday season, which tends to bring up childhood memories and a sense of pressure.","The holidays are an exciting time for parties, sweet treats, shiny decor and family gatherings. “Maintaining financial boundaries during the holiday season is crucial for several reasons.” Advertisement Stevens emphasized that it’s important to resist the temptation to overspend so you can avoid accumulating debt, foster healthy relationships, minimize stress and model financial responsibility. “I think it’s important to decide on a holiday budget well in advance of the holiday season ― this can include travel, food and gifting expenses,” said Samantha Gorelick, managing financial planner at  Brunch & Budget . “Some folks save all year long for the holiday season, but if you didn’t prepare that far in advance, decide now on an amount you will spend and try your best to stick with it.” Advertisement Setting clear limits for different holiday spending areas will help you avoid making impulse purchases. Doing so can cause you to derail your long-term savings goals.” Make a list (and check it twice). “Put the amount you are willing to spend next to each item and/or person before you start shopping, and please, please update it in with your actual spending as you go,” said Anne Lester, a retirement savings expert and author of the upcoming book  “Your Best Financial Life.” She emphasized how easy it is to spend beyond your means, particularly in this era of apps and browser extensions that effectively gamify the process of purchasing expensive items and experiences. Advertisement “It’s important to set realistic and effective boundaries that will make you consider if the thing you are about to get for yourself or someone on your list is really something that is needed ― or even truly wanted,” Lester said. “With high rates of inflation, don’t feel shame if your holiday season might look different than years past,” Howard said. “There might be less gifts under the tree, but maybe they’re more meaningful this year ― like a coupon book for your significant other or spending time with your family on a service project. We should all extend a little more grace this holiday season when it comes to spending.” Start new traditions. But the internet and social media have made it all too easy to fall into that trap. “I think one of the reasons that it becomes easy to violate or ignore financial boundaries is because of the value we’ve been taught spending and overspending on gifts means, as it relates to showing care and showing love,” Stevens said. “In other words, we’ve been taught by the media and our peers that spending equals love, when that’s not necessarily true.” Take the time to consider the beliefs and values you developed growing up, and whether you want to carry them into your holiday spending as an adult. Additionally, each of my kids will receive up to three gifts and one of the gifts will be something that can be used on vacation.” Advertisement Avoid emotional spending. “When it comes to setting financial boundaries this holiday season, be hyper-aware of emotional triggers, social pressure, [fear of missing out] and today’s gift-giving culture,” Howard said. “If you are overspending, explore where you learned this behavior and dig for the root issue behind the spending.” Emotional spending can be a big problem around the holiday season, which tends to bring up childhood memories and a sense of pressure to achieve Hallmark-style “perfection.” “If you feel a rush from shopping, understand your purpose of spending,” Howard said. “Protecting yourself from yourself might look like knowing exactly what gifts you’re buying for others, or only shopping online to reduce extra purchases in store.” Prepare to save after the holidays. So, after the holidays, make a conscious effort to spend less than usual for a couple of months to make up for any overspending during the holidays.” Advertisement Think about your future self. “Think about the dreams you are working towards and how the decision of saving that money today instead will help you get there faster, instead of spending it on a portable monitor or a spin scrubber on TikTok Shop, no matter how many coupons they give you!” she said. “I can’t emphasize enough how important it is to think about taking good care of your future self as well as your current self.” Do you have info to share with HuffPost reporters?",2023-11-28 10:45:01,"[0.1646988401718998, 0.4718313266687102, 0.13149990399152403, 0.11281746886177595, 0.8486633520954692]",,The-1-Thing-You-Need-To-Do-Before-You-Start-Holiday-Shopping-This-Year.wav

Sales create a sense of urgency with buzzy terms like “one day only,” “limited time, “daily deal” and “flash sale” Avoid sale alerts or bricks-and-mortar stores that tempt your spaving impulses.","But other practices are more sneakily harmful ― like “spaving.” “Spaving is the act of spending money to save money,”  Andrea Woroch , a consumer finance and budgeting expert, told HuffPost. “The problem with spaving is that it can trick you into spending more in order to receive a certain savings benefit in return,” said Jacqueline Howard, the head of money wellness at Ally Bank. “Because of the incentive, it’s easy to feel better about adding a few more items to your cart, even if you weren’t planning on making those additional purchases,” Howard explained. Woroch noted that sales create a sense of urgency with buzzy terms like “one day only,” “limited time, “daily deal” and “flash sale” ― making customers feel like they’ll waste a rare opportunity if they don’t pounce. “The reality is, retailers are constantly rolling out new sales, so just because you miss out on a sale today doesn’t mean you can’t get the same item on sale later,” she explained. Many people also feel a sort of high when they score a good deal on an item, regardless of how much they wanted or needed it in the first place. “Even if you get something at a really good sale price, you’re still spending money that could be going towards something more important, like building your savings, paying down debt, investing, etc.,” Woroch said. “A few bucks here and there adds up and can put a huge dent in your overall budget.” Then there’s the fact that sale items often come with limited or nonexistent return policies. Advertisement For some people, spaving leads to credit card debt, which can mean paying interest that far exceeds whatever was saved in the sales deal. Remove the temptation to spave by avoiding sale alerts however possible. “Create a list before you go shopping and stick to it,” Howard suggested. Plus, you can look around your home or closet to see if you already have something like it — because if you do, even another $10 is unnecessary to spend.” She recommended implementing a 24-hour waiting period to confirm that you don’t have the item or something similar, as well as to shop around, compare prices or even look for a refurbished option. Ask yourself, how will you feel about this purchase in three, six or nine months from now?” Westend61 via Getty Images Try to avoid sale alerts or bricks-and-mortar stores that tempt your spaving impulses. “Stay out of stores that have too many deal temptations,” Woroch said. And be on alert whenever you have to shop in person. “Use browser tools that do the deal hunting for you so you don’t get tempted by another sale when looking for a relevant coupon.” She recommended  PriceBlink , which runs an instant price comparison when you’re looking at a product online and presents other sites that are selling the same item for less, as well as  Sidekick  from  CouponCabin . “The time it takes you to fetch your credit card, the urge to buy should pass, helping you avoid an unnecessary purchase.” Advertisement Do a spending audit. “It’s also a good idea to take a look at just how much you’ve spent over the year so far on excess purchases, which can be eye-opening and give you a little fuel to make changes.” She also recommended thinking about the emotions driving your impulse spaving purchases. “Every time you’re tempted to spave, just think about how that money can go towards helping you reach your goal faster.” Advertisement Stop comparing yourself with others. “When we compare our experiences to that of others, we often lose sight of our values and overspend.” You’ve likely heard the expression “keeping up with the Joneses,” which speaks to the social pressure that many people feel to buy things.",2023-11-09 10:45:00,"[0.19030965155115348, 0.12945528402531137, 0.10357154255142573, 0.078551935497706, 0.9644304510785042]",,Are-You-Guilty-Of-‘Spaving’?-Here’s-How-To-Spot-The-Toxic-Spending-Habit.wav

You misunderstand the difference between a springing power or one that goes into immediate effect. A power of attorney document may require witnesses or notarization for validity.","“A power of attorney enables you to proactively plan for unexpected events, such as illness, injury or cognitive decline, which might render you incapable of managing your own affairs,” said David Watson, an estate planning attorney based in Mequon, Wisconsin. Beyond the mistake of not having one to begin with, HuffPost asked estate lawyers about the worst mistakes they commonly see people do with powers of attorney that they want you to avoid. You only get one POA for your health care or finances, but not both types. You misunderstand the difference between a springing power or one that goes into immediate effect. “Health care powers of attorney typically ‘spring’ into action only when the principal becomes incapacitated. Choi said that in the cases of younger people in their 30s and 40s, she would typically recommend a springing power where it “will become effective only when your doctor says, ‘Oh, OK, she doesn’t have capacity to make these decisions.’ And by attaching that letter to the power of attorney, it becomes effective.”  Meanwhile for elderly people who just need help paying bills and accounts online, a springing power of attorney could be “another hurdle” because “the doctors can’t maybe say you’re incapacitated, because you have capacity,” Choi said. Carmen Rosas, an estate planning attorney based in San Mateo, California, said people can approach their power of attorney document with a “set it and forget it” mentality out of discomfort. But this is a legal document you want to review regularly, because it can give your agent a lot of control that you may no longer want to grant if that person is now your ex or estranged child. ‘My child is not like that.’ But you know, if that’s the case, then I wouldn’t have a job.” “If your spouse is getting elderly, has trouble managing money, or any other issues, they may not be a good candidate to make any decisions for you,” Walny said. Depending on your state’s laws, a power of attorney document may require witnesses or notarization for validity. “Overlooking these essential requirements can render the document null and void,” Watson said. “When you make a committee, that often leads to confusion, delay, mistakes and other issues. “You can say things like, ‘Well, they’re able to sell [property] but not until my youngest child reaches the age of 25,’” Rosas said. If you want Medicaid planning, that better be in the document,” Walny said. “If you want broad or narrow gifting powers, that better be in the document. If you want your agent to be able to access intangible assets like your voicemails, online photos or emails, that better be in the document.” Ultimately, creating a power of attorney document will take careful research and potentially awkward conversations, but it’s worth it for the emotional, legal and financial costs you could be sparing yourself and your loved ones. “Let’s say I’m incapacitated right now today, and my husband doesn’t have power of attorney,” Choi said as an example.

For Lopez, working alone helps her efficiently gather insights and data before she has to be in a team setting. Lopez said that managers can also misconstrue Gen Z colleagues not showing up to the office as a lack of team spirit. Gen Zers might prefer doing things solo because they work in a judgmental environment.","“But other than that, if I can do it by myself, I will 99% of the time just prefer to do things by myself.” Advertisement For Lopez, working alone helps her efficiently gather insights and data before she has to be in a team setting, and allows her to finish work on time. I honestly prefer to preserve my energy and over-communicate when it’s drastically needed.” Why Gen Z Prefers More Solo Work At work, Gen Zers’ independence can sometimes create the negative reputation that they are disengaged from the rest of their team. When asked, Gen Z workers said that there is more nuance in why they might want to work alone than these generalized findings suggest. But at the same time, he appreciates when there are colleagues around, too. He said Gen Zers might prefer doing things solo because they work in a judgmental environment. They might be in a workplace where they cannot listen to music uninterrupted, or where eating a snack during a meeting could cause colleagues to think, “Oh, is this really the time to be eating?” With other colleagues present, “you kind of have that magnifying glass on you,” he said. Lopez said that managers can also misconstrue Gen Z colleagues not showing up to the office as a lack of team spirit. What Gen Z And Older Generations Can Learn From Each Other Fernandez said that there should be flexibility for remote work and working alone, but said it can also be helpful for Gen Z professionals to know that “you cannot be efficient with people. As logical as we are, we are emotional beings.” Advertisement Even though it can be inefficient, physically showing up at work can increase relationship-building, and it’s “where you learn to manage dysfunctional teammates, where you learn to negotiate or, frankly, even influence others about your idea,” she said. Guevara said that when he advises Gen Z friends who work remotely and alone, he asks them to separate the situations where it’s comfortable to work alone versus where it’s necessary. “If you need music to work, that’s one thing,” he said. In a 2022 Gallup  poll , Gen Z was the demographic most ambivalent and disengaged with the workplace, but it was not because young workers were slacking off and not caring about their jobs. Most reported missing a close connection to their colleagues, manager or employer. When Fernandez teaches university students, she said that she asks for class volunteers to be her internal focus group, so they can tell her what’s working and what’s not in the classroom. “[Gen Z is] going to be the next set of managers,” Fernandez said. “There’s that preconceived notion that ‘Gen Z is lazy, Gen Z doesn’t like working with other people’ that they’ll use to influence how they approach a situation with someone who happens to be Gen Z.” Advertisement Guevara said that he has Gen Z friends who “get talked down to” by others at work, “as if they don’t know what they’re talking about.” “The way that they talk to people is obviously going to have an impact, especially when there’s a huge age difference,” he said.

If you’ve ever felt like screaming into a pillow or lying on your couch after a hard day at work, you might be feeling something known as “ post-work restraint collapse.","And every year, there’s new language to articulate those long-held but often buried feelings. The Lazy Girl Job This year marked a turning point for how younger professionals are setting their work expectations. Instead, there was the rise of “lazy girl jobs.” In a May  TikTok video , Gabrielle Judge ― a content creator who popularized the term ― defined “lazy girl jobs” as positions where you can have “pretty comfortable salaries, and not do that much work and be remote.”   @gabrielle_judge   Career advice for women who don’t know what remote job to apply to. Women are here to collect those pay checks and move on from the work day. #corporatejobs   #jobsearchhacks   #remoteworking   #antihustleculture   #9to5     ♬ original sound - Anti Work Girlboss     As Judge previously  told  HuffPost: “A ‘lazy girl job’ mindset is all about creating as much freedom and space in your personal life as possible through efficient work days, although not everyone will understand.” Advertisement The LGJ’s wide appeal on TikTok speaks to how professionals are redefining success. Voluntelling If you’ve been quote-unquote “volunteered” for an assignment you didn’t ask for, you’ve actually been “voluntold.” It’s a phrase that was  popularized  by the U.S. military to describe situations where somebody is volunteered for a task without getting the opportunity to say “no,” and with implicit pressure to say “yes.” At work, these assignments may not sound exactly like marching orders, but deep down, you know they are. Advertisement A term like “‘hey’ hanging” perfectly describes the anxiety co-workers may be causing with their messages. Advertisement This summer, more tech employees  complained  that they received these “reassignment” orders from employers. “I don’t see it as ever being a good thing for an employee,” Rahbar warned. “If it were to happen to me, the first thing I would do is probably start my job search immediately for something that did suit my skills where I would be a better fit.” 6. Body Doubling If you work best with an accountability buddy, try a work exercise known as “ body doubling .” With this technique, commonly used by professionals with ADHD, you do a task and have another person on Zoom or in person doing a task too. You might already be doing body doubling without knowing it has a name. It can mean working quietly with a friend in a coffee shop, or it can mean having them finish the same task as you at the same time. Either way, try out this hack if you have trouble concentrating or finishing tasks. Post-Work Restraint Collapse If you’ve ever felt like screaming into a pillow or lying on your couch after a hard day at work, you might be feeling something known as “ post-work restraint collapse .” It’s a concept that therapists are using to describe the bone-deep exhaustion caused by draining work days. Post-work restraint collapse can look like “a sense of depletion and having nothing left for other activities, even things that you might really enjoy, like exercise, spending time with your family or other social activities,”  Emily Treichler , a licensed clinical psychologist, previously told HuffPost about post-work restraint collapse.

According to Connaghan’s 2023  survey  of 380 people who have been Santas, Santa is, on average, 66 years old and most likely to grow his own beard for the job. “You represent something magical, something of a spirit almost where people like to say, ‘Wow,’” said Adrian Walker, who is a Santa based in the Atlanta metro area. “I always tell people, it’s not about believing in Santa as much as it is believing in the possibility of joy and love and just humanity ― just the good that exists.” HuffPost talked with four Santas about the secrets of their profession, from their biggest tips to what keeps them coming back year after year:  Advertisement 1. If we can make a child believe one more year, the parents are so happy. Some do get paid a lot — but there are upfront costs too.

For example, Sinclair is the president of a group on  Facebook  called  Santas of Color Coalition  and he said they offer monthly Zoom trainings on topics like beard maintenance, how to be a storyteller and how to be on social media. Connaghan said the most common challenging question children will ask him is “Can you fix it? Can you get Mom and Dad back together?”  Connaghan said in these situations, he acknowledges what the child is saying but does not make promises about whether he can fix anything.

This guidance applies to both checked and carry-on luggage. Craft scissors are only permitted in checked luggage. Snow globes are considered liquids and will be confiscated by TSA agents.,"Flying during the holidays can come with logistical challenges, especially when gifts are involved. Others might be concerned about packing them securely to avoid damage or other mishaps. But is it OK to fly with wrapped presents? We asked a couple of travel experts to share their advice. What To Know About Taking Wrapped Gifts On Flights “Be sure to follow  TSA guidelines  when packing,” said Cheryl Nelson ,  a travel preparedness expert and founder of  Prepare with Cher . “While there aren’t specific gift wrapping restrictions, there is a chance your perfectly wrapped present with the curled bow could be unwrapped by a TSA agent if your luggage is flagged for safety inspection.” Although there aren’t explicit rules that forbid it, TSA advises against wrapping your gifts before packing them in your suitcase since there’s a chance this could get undone in the security screening process. This guidance applies to both checked and carry-on luggage. “Whether a wrapped gift is in a carry-on bag or checked luggage, if your luggage is flagged at TSA, your gift will be unwrapped,” Nelson said. “This could cause delays for you getting through TSA security and delay your checked luggage from making it on time for your scheduled flight departure.” Advertisement What To Do Instead Understandably, you might not want to risk getting delayed or having your beautiful wrapping paper get torn up. But there are ways to be prepared without having everything fully gift-wrapped. “You can keep your gifts in a gift bag or a box, but you’ll want to make sure that they can be easily opened by TSA agents if they need to be inspected,” said Lindsay Schwimer, a consumer travel expert with the trip-booking app  Hopper . Nelson offered some other suggestions for flying with presents as well. Advertisement Other Things To Keep In Mind As you prepare for your holiday flights, remember that everything you pack in your bag is subject to TSA regulations, including gifts. So if you got someone a set of nice hand lotions, make sure they’re carry-on size or put them in your checked bag. “Travelers who are unsure if an item should be packed in a carry-on or checked bag should check the TSA homepage and reference the ‘ What can I bring? Nelson noted that craft scissors are only permitted in checked luggage, so don’t try to toss them in your carry-on with other gift-wrapping supplies. “Chances are that someone at your destination will likely have scissors you can borrow,” she added. “If you plan to pack a festive snow globe in your carry-on luggage, remember that snow globes are considered liquids and anything liquid larger than 3.4 ounces ― roughly the size of a tennis ball ― will be flagged and confiscated by TSA agents,” she said. “If you plan to gift a snow globe, please carefully wrap it in bubble wrap for protection in your checked luggage.” And remember: If you are flying this holiday season, be sure to take all the  proper precautions  to help reduce the spread of COVID-19.

The Wynn and Encore are many Vegas fans’ go-to spots for luxury.","This rebranding of Vegas as a sports destination is sending a message to would-be visitors: The Gambling Capital of the World has so much more to offer beyond gambling. To help you plan a non-gambling focused Vegas vacation, I’ve compiled some favorite restaurants, attractions and more highlights from Sin City. Where To Stay The hotel options in Las Vegas feel infinite. Advertisement Caroline Bologna/HuffPost From left: Bellagio Conservatory & Botanical Gardens, a room view and Chihuly glass ceiling. Another highlight of this hotel is the  food hall , which boasts culinary delights like Tekka Bar handrolls, Lardo sandwiches, and a unique take on street meat from David Chang at Bāng Bar by Momofuku. If you’re looking to really splash out, the Wynn and Encore are many Vegas fans’ go-to spots for luxury ― there’s even a golf course on site. Peppermill Restaurant and Fireside Lounge  is an iconic diner that’s been around for more than 50 years. I also tried Martha Stewart’s restaurant,  The Bedford , which transports you to her New York farmhouse, and I got a taste of NYC with brunch at  Sadelle’s . For more casual sports bar vibes, I’ve also had a nice time at  Flanker , which serves elevated game day food. Advertisement What To Drink Of course, Vegas is famous for nightclubs like XS, Omnia and Marquee. Sin City is home to many speakeasy-style bars, several of which are inside the Cosmopolitan. Ghost Donkey  is located in the food hall, and specializes in tequila and mezcal, while  The Barbershop Cuts & Cocktails  is actually located behind a functioning barbershop. And hungry night owls might be interested in the food-focused speakeasy:  Secret Pizza . Advertisement For those who prefer to engage in an activity while they drink,  Flight Club  offers its “Social Darts” experience with a modern take on traditional bar darts and lots of sharable bites to sample with your drinks. Cirque du Soleil is always a classic, and I’ve had the chance to see Blue Man Group, plus concerts from Carrie Underwood and Taylor Swift in the past.

As we learned from our   exploration into Uggs , shoes that are too roomy can cause issues because they force you to overuse the muscles and tendons in your feet. “Consistently wearing this style of shoe over time can increase your risk of developing bunions.” In general, a tapered toe box, which is common in fashion boots, should be avoided when looking for boots that are good for foot health, added  Dr. Advertisement Instead, look for “a toe box that fits the shape of your foot,” Tarr advised. “High heels, especially those exceeding a comfortable height, can strain the feet and contribute to issues like ball-of-foot pain,” Fox noted. The soft fabric can be especially beneficial for people who have “bony enlargements” in their feet, he said. Using the wrong type of footwear for an activity may lead to discomfort, pain, or even injuries,” Fox said. If you’re trekking on more rugged terrain, make sure your footwear is up for the challenge.

Dance heels are designed to look good and Repetto ,  Capezio ,  Vamp,   Aida Dance ,  Very Fine ,  Burju  and  Vivaz are among them.","I’ve been looking forward to reuniting with family and friends at weddings long-postponed by the pandemic. Advertisement During another online shopping expedition to find somewhat-bearable-yet-aesthetically-pleasing shoes, I came across  two   TikTok videos   suggesting a heel I had overlooked — the dance heel. Many  ballroom, latin and heels (a dance style performed while wearing high-heeled shoes — think Beyoncé’s  “Single Ladies” ) dancers  perform complicated, physically intense dance routines while wearing heels (even stilettos). So, if dance heels can give dancers the comfort and support they need to practice and perform, can’t the everyday heels-wearer also benefit from them? Depending on the shape of your foot though, that may be true. “Some women have feet that are narrower [in the front] and it’s easier for them to wear high heels. Although regular heels’ function is primarily aesthetic, dance heels are designed to look good and Repetto ,  Capezio ,  Vamp,   Aida Dance ,  Very Fine ,  Burju  and  Vivaz. Advertisement “Dancing heels allow you to bear more weight on the heel,” Lee said. So, she  knows the difference between regular and dance heels all too well. “They’re trying to design their equipment — in this case, their shoes — to be as functional and efficient as possible so they can perform at the highest level.” For Baramo, her specialized Burju shoes help her do just that. I’d say we had our shoes on for about five hours. Whether or not you want to invest in dance heels boils down to your aesthetic, desired comfort level and how well your feet can tolerate heels. But certainly, it’s going to be more comfortable than wearing your traditional stiletto.” My hopes were high. Unfortunately, my feet still were throbbing after a night on the dance floor. Finding a heel that works for your foot just comes down to trial and error.

We asked a fashion stylist, a fashion editor, and fashion designer what trends they would never wear. ""Copy cats happen because there’s no copyright protecting fashion,” said Beverly Osemwenkhae.","Part of the trend cycle is understanding that what was once ugly is suddenly considered posh, and vice versa, because all aesthetics are not only subjective, but also related to zeitgeist. Advertisement Haute couture has always dipped a toe into what we might consider “ugly fashion,” because accessibility and wearability aren’t the primary concerns here. Around 2014 with the popularization of  Normcore , “ugly fashion” became more mainstream, and a way for people to rebel against beauty standards without spending thousands of dollars on a Balenciaga coat. Having said all that, there are many of us who don’t want to look ugly on purpose, but rather dress to capture an aesthetic that reads as polished, put together and also woke. We’ll avoid calling this aesthetic “stylish,” for as noted above looking ugly can be considered  en vogue . And we’ll also avoid talking about this aesthetic as “flattering,” because that term is not only subjective but has come to be a euphemism for “slimming.”  Instead, let’s call these trends “not wearable.” Ahead, we asked a fashion stylist, a fashion editor, and fashion designer what trends they would never wear — and yes, while aesthetics were highly considered, they weren’t the only reasons our style experts noted for not wearing a trend. Flip Flop Heels Beverly Osemwenkhae , a fashion stylist in New York and London, noted the shoe choice doesn’t “look comfortable,” and that it defies a put-together look. Not because I don’t think they’re cool but because I feel that there is an imminent expiration date.” She called the look passé (and not in a nostalgic way.) “They’ve garnered attention with everything else Y2K, like low-rise, cropped tops, and racer-style leather jackets. They’re not very versatile, which will likely be a collective turn-off as minimalist, capsule-like wardrobes become more popular. Another Y2K turn-off is the denim silhouette that  rose to popularity in 2000  after being worn by stars like Jennifer Lopez and Britney Spears, which Osemwenkhae called incredibly “dated.” She added it is a “Y2k trend that belongs in the past.”  4. For what it’s worth,  podiatrists don’t love them , either. There’s a general consensus in medicine and fashion that deems this style of accessory pretty useless. I, for one, like to have something that shields my eyes, lids and sometimes eyebrows from the sun. “Copy cats happen because there’s no copyright protecting fashion,” she explained, pointing out that accounts like  Diet Prada  serve as community watchdogs, letting the public know when imitations go down.

""Jawline enhancement is easily the most popular facial aesthetic procedure for men after Botox,"" said Dr. Chris Bustamante of New York City. Girth enhancement, or the injection of hyaluronic acid into the penis for a fuller look, is a booming enterprise.","Still, recent data indicates an uptick in elective cosmetic procedures for men. Nonetheless, we had a look at what types of procedures are most popular with men and why they’re pursuing them now. (The same Google Trends tool was referenced in studies about plastic surgery pre- and post-COVID, and is considered an effective way to “determine a relationship between public interest in plastic surgery after the celebrity popularization of specific procedures,” according to the aforementioned study.) “ At Lushful Aesthetics more than 95% of our patients are men, so we truly get to see these trends unfold,” he said. “Men contributed to this high water mark, however, in the same relative proportion as they have historically.” Ahead, we break down three of the most popular elective male plastic surgery trends of 2023, and experts offer explanations for why these procedures are on our cultural radar. Jawline enhancement is easily the most popular facial aesthetic procedure for men after Botox.”  Advertisement In additional to jawline filler,  Kolker  noted that facial augmentation, specifically “contouring procedures, otoplasty (ear reshaping) surgery, neck lift surgery, and facelift surgery” as well as nonsurgical treatments like Botox, “have been, and remain, extremely popular among men.” He said that a subtle look when it comes to facial augmentation has “been associated with wider acceptance among men.” “Men have also been increasingly comfortable seeking and discussing nonsurgical fillers, and energy-based resurfacing treatments,” Bustamante said. Volanthevist via Getty Images ""Jawline enhancement is easily the most popular facial aesthetic procedure for men after Botox,"" said  Dr. Chris Bustamante  of New York City. The “you, but better” aesthetic is one that appeals to people regardless of gender, and supports an idea that your looks are something you can and should optimize. Moreover, there’s less of a stigma attached to this idea than in previous generations, since how we present ourselves in culture is seen as a mark of our overall success. And although the average man isn’t in the movies, he likely still has to appear on a screen sometimes, whether in his professional or social life. “Male breast tissue and recalcitrant areas of soft tissue excess around the midsection can be safely and effectively treated with cosmetic surgery.” Girth enhancement Girth enhancement, or the injection of hyaluronic acid into the penis for a fuller look, is a booming enterprise for  Bustamante. “We’re doing about three to four penis filler treatments a day, making this our fastest-growing procedure,” he said. Bustamante noted that it’s important to remember that “ women are bombarded with beauty ads every second of every day.” Men, on the other hand, he suggested, don’t face the same thing, at least not as much. “Men are more streamlined in regards to aesthetic procedures,” he said. “They have more breathing room.” But this is likely to change, if the rise in plastic surgery in the population as a whole is anything to go by.
