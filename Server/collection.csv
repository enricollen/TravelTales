Police were falsely led to believe there was a shooting at her home. Officers quickly “determined no shooting took place,” according to a police report.","U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan, who is overseeing former President Donald Trump’s criminal election interference case in Washington, D.C., appears to have been targeted by a “swatting” call, in which police were falsely led to believe there was a shooting at her home. Officers quickly “determined no shooting took place,” according to a police report obtained by HuffPost. Advertisement NBC News revealed  on Monday that the home belongs to Chutkan. “Former Presidents enjoy no special conditions on their federal criminal liability,” she wrote in her  ruling last month . He called her a “true Trump hater,” in all capital letters, in October and claimed that she would not be able to preside over a fair trial against him,  according to ABC News . In 2021, more than 4,500 threats were made against U.S. judges as political tensions grew,  Reuters reported . In 2022, a man was charged with attempting to kill Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh,  CNN reported . Recently, authorities have been looking into  threats against the Colorado Supreme Court judges  who ruled that Trump’s name could not be included on the state’s primary ballot . As such, Chutkan,  like many other judges , is no stranger to threats in the current political climate. Chutkan, who was nominated by Barack Obama, has developed a reputation for handing down sentences against Jan. 6 defendants that are more severe than what prosecutors had sought,  according to The Associated Press.

On Monday, Mr Hollinrake met Justice Secretary Alex Chalk to discuss what he called ""one of the greatest miscarriages of justice in our history"". Between 1999 and 2015, the Post Office prosecuted 736 sub-postmasters and sub-postmistresses - an average of one a week - based on information from a computer system called Horizon.

The vote also demands ministers reveal cash given and set to be given to the East African country. In addition, Labour want to see the full memorandum of understanding ministers reached with Rwanda. The plan has been repeatedly delayed by legal challenges and no asylum seekers have been sent to Rwanda from the UK so far. Sir Keir Starmer's party also want the government to publish papers revealed by the BBC which suggest  Rishi Sunak had initially wanted to scale back the scheme  when he was chancellor in 2022. Those documents were prepared in No 10 when Boris Johnson was trying to persuade Mr Sunak to sign off on the plan. On Sunday  Mr Sunak denied ever doubting the policy  would work, saying it was his job as chancellor to ask ""tough questions"" about the cost of every policy that crossed his desk. Labour want to force the vote on Tuesday afternoon as part of an opposition day, which allows the party to choose a subject for debate. Tuesday's parliamentary gambit will force a Home Office minister to come to the Commons to justify the government's position on Rwanda before the next phase of parliamentary debates and votes on the  Safety of Rwanda Bill , which would state that Rwanda should be considered a safe country under British law along with other provisions designed to put the policy on a stronger legal footing.

Without the ability to charge batteries, the mission's plan to land on the Moon may not be possible. The 1.2-tonne lander was launched from Cape Canaveral on a Vulcan rocket.","1 minute ago About sharing Watch: Vulcan rocket sends Moon mission on its way The private US Moon mission launched on Monday has run into technical problems. The Astrobotic company behind the project says its Peregrine spacecraft has experienced an ""anomaly"" that has stopped it from pointing its solar panels stably at the Sun. Without the ability to charge batteries, the mission's plan to land on the Moon may not be possible. Astrobotic said engineers were working on the issue and would provide updates when it had more information. The 1.2-tonne lander was launched from Cape Canaveral, Florida, on a Vulcan rocket. It is aiming to become the first American mission in half a century to make a soft landing on the Moon - first commercial endeavour to do so. The US space agency has purchased capacity on the lander for five instruments to study the lunar environment ahead of sending astronauts later this decade. The 1.2-tonne Peregrine spacecraft is one of a clutch of US projects aiming to land in 2024 Astrobotic said the mission started to encounter problems as it was being put through post-launch checks. The issue occurred after communications had been established with Peregrine and all its systems had been powered up. Peregrine was struggling to maintain a stable lock on the Sun, enabling its solar panels to receive a constant supply of sunshine to generate electricity. Without power, it has no mission. ""The team believes that the most likely cause of the unstable Sun-pointing is a propulsion anomaly that, if proven true, threatens the ability of the spacecraft to soft-land on the Moon,"" the company said in a statement, adding: ""As the team fights to troubleshoot the issue, the spacecraft battery is reaching operationally low levels."" It is not unusual for spacecraft to experience technical hitches and Astrobotic engineers will have rehearsed many times how to respond to a variety fault scenarios. And the spacecraft itself will also have been programmed to protect itself during such events, prioritising power and communications back to Earth.

Mr Tate is being investigated in the country over  allegations of human trafficking and rape , which he denies. On Monday, Bucharest's Court of Appeal ordered a new trial over the held assets, which includes luxury cars. Mr Tate's brother Tristan and two associated companies were also parties to the successful appeal. The decision means the Tate brothers will be able to return to court and mount a new legal effort to reclaim their seized assets. Two companies, SC Ground Breaking Development SRL and The Cannon Run Limited, were listed alongside the Tate brothers as parties in the appeal. In a post on his official Twitter account, Andrew Tate said a court will now have to demonstrate the wealth was acquired illegally in order to justify the ongoing seizure, adding: ""They won't prove a thing because it never happened."" Court documents released in June indicated the brothers had amassed millions of euros and acquired expensive assets and properties via their business activities, which included adult content and online self-help courses. Both Tate brothers deny  charges levelled by Romanian investigators  that they exploited women via their adult content business, which prosecutors allege operated as a criminal group. Two female Romanian associates were also named alongside the British-American brothers in an indictment published in June, and seven alleged victims were identified. The brothers were first arrested in December 2022 and spent time in prison before being place under house arrest. While  they are no long under detention , the brothers are prohibited from leaving Romania while the investigation progresses. In January 2023, expensive cars  were seen being removed from a property associated with the Tates  near Bucharest. Watches worth millions of euros were also confiscated during the raids.

He was one of three Muslim hosts at the network alongside colleagues Ayman Mohyeldin and Ali Velshi, and one of just a few on network TV.

Ro Khanna (D-Calif.), wrote on X at the time. “As a strong supporter of free speech, MSNBC owes the public an explanation for this decision. Why would they choose to do this now?” Hasan’s coverage often went viral on social media as he took aim at former President Donald Trump and supported the Palestinian people.

Literally Media, which owns Know Your Meme, Cracked and other brands, announced Friday that it acquired Mel magazine for an undisclosed amount. Oren Katzeff, CEO ofliterally Media, said he wanted to acquire Mel for its unique voice and a loyal audience.","Men are so back: Mel magazine, an audacious digital media site for the guys, will get a new lease on life next year after its unceremonious dissolution in 2022. Literally Media, which owns Know Your Meme, Cracked and other brands, announced Friday that it acquired Mel magazine for an undisclosed amount. Originally a content site for the Dollar Shave Club, Mel was  once  “the rare men’s magazine that has taken upon itself to investigate masculinity, not enforce it.” Advertisement Oren Katzeff, CEO of Literally Media, told HuffPost that he wanted to acquire Mel for its unique voice and a loyal audience. Katzeff said he would like to have three to five people on staff with a mix of full-time and freelance employees and then “grow from there.” Katzeff said he plans to package Mel “with opportunities beyond the articles on site,” which will include a newsletter strategy as well as introducing video, which will open “more doors” to brand deals. Advertisement “There’s really a ripe opportunity for Mel to expand beyond just the website into at the very least video and possibly audio as well,” Katzeff said. “Literally Media as a company years ago was probably doing anywhere from 10 to 15 million video views a month, and now we’re doing in the hundreds of millions. So I’m pretty bullish in terms of Mel’s opportunity in both the video and audio space moving forward.” Mel magazine’s stories included headlines like  “Our Eternal Horniness for the Camp Counselor”  and  “I Tried Mark Wahlberg’s Catholic App to See If It Could Reconnect Me With God.”  Mel magazine reached 4 million unique monthly visitors during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, according to a news release, but in  March 2021, it ceased publication . A few months later, Recurrent Ventures acquired it only to pull the plug in 2022  and lay off all staff members . Katzeff said it’s “more challenging that ever” to run a successful media company. “And, you know, what I hope with an acquisition like this is that we can also leverage some of the success we’ve had with our other brands to help revive some of the audience on Mel. And so, my guess would be as we go into 2024, if the market conditions continue as they are, which is, again, greater challenges in terms of audience, greater challenges in terms of monetization, I think we may see more and more opportunities like these.” Advertisement Support HuffPost The Stakes Have Never Been Higher At HuffPost, we believe that everyone needs high-quality journalism, but we understand that not everyone can afford to pay for expensive news subscriptions.

Evan has been wrongfully detained for more than 250 days for simply doing his job as a journalist, and any portrayal to the contrary is fiction. Thursday’s court hearing and previous hearings have been held behind closed doors because prosecutors say details of the criminal case are classified.

An exchange between Gomez, Swift and Miles Teller’s wife, Keleigh Sperry, went viral after some  lip readers suggested the conversation  was supposedly about Jenner’s refusal to let Gomez take a photo with Chalamet.

After Keleigh Teller asked “With Timothee?” Gomez nodded. In one of them, Gomez supposedly says, “Possibly, but I’m in love with it, which is a reference I’m not gonna quit, I’m in love,” to which Swift supposedly responds,  “No fucking way dude, you’ll have a job getting that removed, you know,” Freeman also suggested Gomez could have said,  “Do you know what they said/did to me?” to which Swift may have replied,  “Shit, what the...” and later said, “Oh my God, love you.”  Selena supposedly replied “Brought them back together.” The National Deaf Childrens Society  in Britain suggests lip reading on its own is only accurate between 30 and 40 percent of the time.

It’s a red flag if the seller has every size and color available. Some scammers impersonate airline customer service agents to get your personal and banking information.,"But often, you may not know the charity was a scam until it’s too late. “Any good, legitimate charity will take your money today, tomorrow, or the next day,” Nofziger said. “But of course, you either don’t receive the goods and now your payment information is exfiltrated.” To avoid losing money, do a gut check with yourself about those deals you spot on the internet. Nofziger said it’s a red flag if the seller has every size and color available when any other website is sold out of that item. Advertisement That’s because scammers are known to tamper with gift cards on display racks and set it up so that  when you register to activate them, the scammer will be notified  and they can spend or transfer the funds before you or your gift recipient can use it. Some scammers impersonate airline customer service agents to get your personal and banking information. Because imposters often make fraudulent airline websites, Nofziger said you should also be wary of clicking airfare links you found via a search engine result and instead should go directly to the airline’s website. And actually, I can offer you a $50 discount if you can get me an Amex [American Express] gift card because we’re running a special with Amex,” Nofziger said as an example. It also helps to check the seller’s reviews and see if they have had a large number of disputes and chargebacks in the past because that’s a red flag, Jabbara said. “You might get a text message from FedEx or USPS saying that they weren’t able to deliver a package because there was missing information on your account: ‘Just click here to fill the information out, your package will be coming,’” Nofziger said as an example. Beyond avoiding suspiciously misspelled text messages, keep track of what you’re buying to know who delivers your package and when. Your options are more limited if it is with cash or not on a card. “If you’re using a peer-to-peer app or using cash or wire transfer or some of non-card payment method, your recourse is somewhat more limited and undefined,” Jabbara said, noting that whether you get money back will depend on the service’s specific policies, and sometimes “it’s kind of a ‘you’re on your own approach.’” Report the scam to authorities. Help prevent others from getting scammed by filing a complaint with the Federal Trade Commission  online  or calling 877-382-4357.

Setting clear limits for different holiday spending areas will help you avoid making impulse purchases. Emotional spending can be a big problem around the Holiday season, which tends to bring up childhood memories and a sense of pressure.","The holidays are an exciting time for parties, sweet treats, shiny decor and family gatherings. “Maintaining financial boundaries during the holiday season is crucial for several reasons.” Advertisement Stevens emphasized that it’s important to resist the temptation to overspend so you can avoid accumulating debt, foster healthy relationships, minimize stress and model financial responsibility. “I think it’s important to decide on a holiday budget well in advance of the holiday season ― this can include travel, food and gifting expenses,” said Samantha Gorelick, managing financial planner at  Brunch & Budget . “Some folks save all year long for the holiday season, but if you didn’t prepare that far in advance, decide now on an amount you will spend and try your best to stick with it.” Advertisement Setting clear limits for different holiday spending areas will help you avoid making impulse purchases. Doing so can cause you to derail your long-term savings goals.” Make a list (and check it twice). “Put the amount you are willing to spend next to each item and/or person before you start shopping, and please, please update it in with your actual spending as you go,” said Anne Lester, a retirement savings expert and author of the upcoming book  “Your Best Financial Life.” She emphasized how easy it is to spend beyond your means, particularly in this era of apps and browser extensions that effectively gamify the process of purchasing expensive items and experiences. Advertisement “It’s important to set realistic and effective boundaries that will make you consider if the thing you are about to get for yourself or someone on your list is really something that is needed ― or even truly wanted,” Lester said. “With high rates of inflation, don’t feel shame if your holiday season might look different than years past,” Howard said. “There might be less gifts under the tree, but maybe they’re more meaningful this year ― like a coupon book for your significant other or spending time with your family on a service project. We should all extend a little more grace this holiday season when it comes to spending.” Start new traditions. But the internet and social media have made it all too easy to fall into that trap. “I think one of the reasons that it becomes easy to violate or ignore financial boundaries is because of the value we’ve been taught spending and overspending on gifts means, as it relates to showing care and showing love,” Stevens said. “If you are overspending, explore where you learned this behavior and dig for the root issue behind the spending.” Emotional spending can be a big problem around the holiday season, which tends to bring up childhood memories and a sense of pressure to achieve Hallmark-style “perfection.” “If you feel a rush from shopping, understand your purpose of spending,” Howard said. So, after the holidays, make a conscious effort to spend less than usual for a couple of months to make up for any overspending during the holidays.” Advertisement Think about your future self. “I can’t emphasize enough how important it is to think about taking good care of your future self as well as your current self.” Do you have info to share with HuffPost reporters?",2023-11-28 10:45:01,"[0.0047818697819469146, 0.998813755706234, 0.004219610270733564, 0.002925022030511996, 0.02104494254826214, 0.0018254263704882306, 0.0067544581294479945, 0.005228989193899501, 0.014667375768589282, 0.0060973509713155, 0.002843563606224687, 0.002266337424524135, 0.03613279365679153, 0.015216994782834994]",,The-1-Thing-You-Need-To-Do-Before-You-Start-Holiday-Shopping-This-Year.wav

Here’s How To Spot The Toxic Spending Habit.,"“Spaving is the act of spending money to save money,” Andrea Woroch , a consumer finance and budgeting expert, told HuffPost. Sales create a sense of urgency with buzzy terms like “one day only,’ “limited time, “daily deal” and “flash sale” Woroch recommended implementing a 24-hour waiting period to confirm that you don’t have the item.","But other practices are more sneakily harmful ― like “spaving.” “Spaving is the act of spending money to save money,”  Andrea Woroch , a consumer finance and budgeting expert, told HuffPost. “The problem with spaving is that it can trick you into spending more in order to receive a certain savings benefit in return,” said Jacqueline Howard, the head of money wellness at Ally Bank. “Because of the incentive, it’s easy to feel better about adding a few more items to your cart, even if you weren’t planning on making those additional purchases,” Howard explained. Woroch noted that sales create a sense of urgency with buzzy terms like “one day only,” “limited time, “daily deal” and “flash sale” ― making customers feel like they’ll waste a rare opportunity if they don’t pounce. “The reality is, retailers are constantly rolling out new sales, so just because you miss out on a sale today doesn’t mean you can’t get the same item on sale later,” she explained. Many people also feel a sort of high when they score a good deal on an item, regardless of how much they wanted or needed it in the first place. “Even if you get something at a really good sale price, you’re still spending money that could be going towards something more important, like building your savings, paying down debt, investing, etc.,” Woroch said. “A few bucks here and there adds up and can put a huge dent in your overall budget.” Then there’s the fact that sale items often come with limited or nonexistent return policies. Advertisement For some people, spaving leads to credit card debt, which can mean paying interest that far exceeds whatever was saved in the sales deal. “Create a list before you go shopping and stick to it,” Howard suggested. Plus, you can look around your home or closet to see if you already have something like it — because if you do, even another $10 is unnecessary to spend.” She recommended implementing a 24-hour waiting period to confirm that you don’t have the item or something similar, as well as to shop around, compare prices or even look for a refurbished option. Ask yourself, how will you feel about this purchase in three, six or nine months from now?” Westend61 via Getty Images Try to avoid sale alerts or bricks-and-mortar stores that tempt your spaving impulses. “Stay out of stores that have too many deal temptations,” Woroch said. “Use browser tools that do the deal hunting for you so you don’t get tempted by another sale when looking for a relevant coupon.” She recommended  PriceBlink , which runs an instant price comparison when you’re looking at a product online and presents other sites that are selling the same item for less, as well as  Sidekick  from  CouponCabin . “It’s also a good idea to take a look at just how much you’ve spent over the year so far on excess purchases, which can be eye-opening and give you a little fuel to make changes.” She also recommended thinking about the emotions driving your impulse spaving purchases.",2023-11-09 10:45:00,"[0.0033376597253139957, 0.9990855825193905, 0.0032240617681902482, 0.0023047431409522804, 0.011720361762093887, 0.0014122959742005295, 0.006314800360247164, 0.003592926349670889, 0.010922349059019317, 0.003970155308072179, 0.00279244879176323, 0.0018966598555784223, 0.03735186602481079, 0.00820903798169628]",,Are-You-Guilty-Of-Spaving-Heres-How-To-Spot-The-Toxic-Spending-Habit.wav

You misunderstand the difference between a springing power or one that goes into immediate effect. If you want broad or narrow gifting powers, that better be in the document.","“A power of attorney enables you to proactively plan for unexpected events, such as illness, injury or cognitive decline, which might render you incapable of managing your own affairs,” said David Watson, an estate planning attorney based in Mequon, Wisconsin. Beyond the mistake of not having one to begin with, HuffPost asked estate lawyers about the worst mistakes they commonly see people do with powers of attorney that they want you to avoid. You only get one POA for your health care or finances, but not both types. You misunderstand the difference between a springing power or one that goes into immediate effect. “Health care powers of attorney typically ‘spring’ into action only when the principal becomes incapacitated. Choi said that in the cases of younger people in their 30s and 40s, she would typically recommend a springing power where it “will become effective only when your doctor says, ‘Oh, OK, she doesn’t have capacity to make these decisions.’ And by attaching that letter to the power of attorney, it becomes effective.”  Meanwhile for elderly people who just need help paying bills and accounts online, a springing power of attorney could be “another hurdle” because “the doctors can’t maybe say you’re incapacitated, because you have capacity,” Choi said. But this is a legal document you want to review regularly, because it can give your agent a lot of control that you may no longer want to grant if that person is now your ex or estranged child. ‘My child is not like that.’ But you know, if that’s the case, then I wouldn’t have a job.” “If your spouse is getting elderly, has trouble managing money, or any other issues, they may not be a good candidate to make any decisions for you,” Walny said. Depending on your state’s laws, a power of attorney document may require witnesses or notarization for validity. “When you make a committee, that often leads to confusion, delay, mistakes and other issues. “You can say things like, ‘Well, they’re able to sell [property] but not until my youngest child reaches the age of 25,’” Rosas said. “If you want broad or narrow gifting powers, that better be in the document. If you want your agent to be able to access intangible assets like your voicemails, online photos or emails, that better be in the document.” Ultimately, creating a power of attorney document will take careful research and potentially awkward conversations, but it’s worth it for the emotional, legal and financial costs you could be sparing yourself and your loved ones. “Let’s say I’m incapacitated right now today, and my husband doesn’t have power of attorney,” Choi said as an example.

Lopez said that managers can also misconstrue Gen Z colleagues not showing up to the office as a lack of team spirit. As logical as we are, we are emotional beings.” Advertisement Even though it can be inefficient, physically showing up at work can increase relationship-building, and it’s “where you learn to manage dysfunctional teammates, where you learn to negotiate or, frankly, even influence others about your idea,” she said. Guevara said that when he advises Gen Z friends who work remotely and alone, he asks them to separate the situations where it’s comfortable to work alone versus where it’s necessary. In a 2022 Gallup  poll , Gen Z was the demographic most ambivalent and disengaged with the workplace, but it was not because young workers were slacking off and not caring about their jobs. When Fernandez teaches university students, she said that she asks for class volunteers to be her internal focus group, so they can tell her what’s working and what’s not in the classroom. “There’s that preconceived notion that ‘Gen Z is lazy, Gen Z doesn’t like working with other people’ that they’ll use to influence how they approach a situation with someone who happens to be Gen Z.” Advertisement Guevara said that he has Gen Z friends who “get talked down to” by others at work, “as if they don’t know what they’re talking about.” “The way that they talk to people is obviously going to have an impact, especially when there’s a huge age difference,” he said.

If we can make a child believe one more year, the parents are so happy. Some do get paid a lot — but there are upfront costs too. For Walker, those investments are worth it because of the magic they help create. Connaghan said the most common challenging question children will ask him is “Can you fix it? Can you get Mom and Dad back together?”  Connaghan said in these situations, he acknowledges what the child is saying but does not make promises about whether he can fix anything.

In her book, Papalia wrote that challengers can have trouble prepping for interviews because they feel fake and inauthentic. Examiners are motivated by the desire to “get it right” in interviews, Papalia said. That’s much different than their polar opposite, a Challenger, who’s over here wanting to be respected and heard.” Advertisement Where Harmonizers Can Self-Sabotage Harmonizers are great collaborators, but in interviews they can place too much emphasis on the collective group over themselves, so much so that interviewers are left wondering, “Well, what did you do?” Papalia said. She noted that while Challengers have a “clear sense of self that is less amenable to how somebody is going respond,” the Harmonizers she’s worked with lack a clear sense of their own value. If you want to win a Challenger over, ask them tough questions, Papalia recommended: “They don’t like pushovers. They love to be challenged.” Meanwhile, you can win a Charmer over with compliments and laughing at their jokes, or a Harmonizer by selling your great teamwork, or an Examiner by complimenting their professionalism and technical proficiency, Papalia said.

The Wolverhampton race meeting was held on Sunday night. The meeting was a trial for the track to see if it can increase betting turnover. British racing needs several hundred jockey at any given time to keep it on the road.,"A  winning jockey’s post-race comments after picking up a decent prize rarely stray beyond gratitude to the horse’s owner and trainer, and how much they are looking forward to being aboard next time up. “We don’t need to be here on a Sunday evening,” Shepherd told Sky Sports Racing. “We might get a couple of hundred quid extra in our pockets or whatever, but I don’t think it’s healthy. I won’t be able to go and watch the football with my dad, things like that, and if this becomes a regular thing, which it will, you just cross the brink [to] having absolutely no work/life balance. “I don’t think it’s right, but my desire to ride winners, and my desire to ride for David [Simcock, Charlie’s Choice’s trainer] outweighs that and it has to as a rider, with the dedication it requires. It’s not an option not to come, so I’ll always be available to them, but I don’t think we should be here at 8.30pm on a Sunday night.” Of course, it was not just jockeys whose presence was demanded at Wolverhampton on Sunday evening. The paid attendance was, inevitably, in lowish three figures, but stable and racecourse staff including stewards and officials were also essential to ensure that what was, for the track and grade, an unusually valuable card went ahead, with full fields in most of the races. “Callum’s comments are perfectly understandable and certainly we respect and appreciate that it does put a lot of strain on the people servicing the fixtures,” Wayman said, “whether that’s trainers, stable staff, our own officials, there’s a lot of people involved in putting a race meeting on. “As part of the trial we will get feedback from all of those people as well as measuring customer demand, and at the end we will be able to take a view on whether this is something we should be thinking about longer term or not. But only by trying it do we think we’ll be able to answer that question.” What sets jockeys apart from other racecourse workers, though – apart from the physical demands and risks that come with the job – is the fact that almost all of them are freelancers, with no set number of hours or days in their contract or the right to take a different day off in lieu. And while they could, in theory, refuse to work on a Sunday evening, in practice, as Shepherd pointed out, it simply does not work like that. Sunday’s card at Wolverhampton, and the meetings at other all-weather tracks over the next five weeks, are aimed almost entirely at an off-course audience, and a primary measure of its success, or otherwise, will be the amount of extra betting turnover generated. “[But] even if it does do that, it doesn’t necessarily mean it will carry on, we will consider it in the round.” Quite how the quantitative data on betting turnover will be measured against more qualitative concerns such as the impact on work/life balance, in particular for jockeys and other workers with families, is unclear, however.

This time around, there’s a greater level of responsibility and obligation to her wellbeing on the part of Australia’s coach, Tony Gustavsson, and his sports science team that entails not only her long-term ability to contribute for the Matildas but also the talismanic role she plays for football, especially women’s football, on a global scale. Kerr will be relied upon as a key contributor on the road to the 2027 Women’s World Cup (if she wants to be) and it’s likely that Australia will host the 2026 Women’s Asian Cup – another opportunity to lift a major trophy on home soil.

The host nation will kick off the tournament on Saturday, as they take on Guinea-Bissau in Abidjan. This will only be the second time that these African nations have collided on the football pitch.","Huge international action gets underway this weekend, as the Africa Cup of Nations finally gets started in the Ivory Coast. The host nation will kick off the tournament on Saturday, as they bid to make a dream start when they take on Guinea-Bissau in Abidjan. Africa Cup of Nations Preview  There is always massive pressure on the host nation of any major international tournament, and that will be the case once again for the Africa Cup of Nations in 2024. Their performances in the tournament since winning the competition have been disappointing, as they have reached the quarterfinal stage on just one from three occasions. Meanwhile, they reached just the round of 16 stage in the 2021 edition of AFCON. But, they come into the tournament in excellent form, claiming a third straight success before the start of the competition when beating Sierra Leone 5-1 in early January. Bet here   Guinea-Bissau are already one of the stars of AFCON, as they upset all the odds to book their passage through to the major tournament. The African nation has now successfully managed to qualify for each of the last three major tournaments, but they are still yet to win a fixture at the Africa Cup of Nations. They will be among the outsiders to gain qualification from Group A this year, and they come into the tournament after a disappointing recent performance in a friendly against Mali in early January. In that fixture, they conceded six goals, which was more than they had allowed in seven internationals in 2023. Ivory Coast vs Guinea-Bissau Head to Head  This will only be the second time that these African nations have collided on the football pitch. The only previous meeting came in the West Africa Nations Cup in 2001, with the Ivory Coast landing a straightforward 4-1 success. Ivory Coast vs Guinea-Bissau Prediction  The Ivory Coast appear to be one of the standout nations in the race for AFCON glory this year.

None other than UFC welterweight Shavkat Rakhmonov featured in a collaborative Instagram reel this week via espnmma & SportsCenter due to himself missing his sister’s wedding due to the undefeated welterweight competing at UFC296 against Stephen Thompson. This reel showcased a clip captured via a user-generated content account dedicated to the 17-0 fighter, which appears to be identified on X. From a marketing perspective, this is a good move for brands, fighters and marketers to raise awareness via a single post to make your audience notice other channels you’re present on, meaning they’re more likely to give you a follow or engagement, which can only benefit your brand. Casuals Corner once again gets the TikTok game spot on! There are so many tick boxes that Casuals Corner has been able to tick through this single post; here are what they are the timing of UFC296 and creating content dedicated to Leon Edwards discussing about Leon outside of his niche (away from MMA) consistent engagement in the comments section The main focus I’d like to highlight is the consistency that Casuals Corner practices in engaging each consumer who watches their content. This is an important habit for fighters, brands, and marketers to get into when establishing a community via social media, as it helps with loyal supporters of your brand, which can pay long-term dividends.

From a social media marketing perspective, social media algorithms appreciate accessibility with regard to content production. What this means is the more inclusive and accessible your content is for different audiences, the more likely it is for it to get ranked higher on your desired audiences’ feeds when scrolling X is where it’s at for user-generated content This has been a theme I’ve noticed for a very long time on X! For combat sports, in particular, fan art is becoming increasingly popular. By endorsing user-generated content as a fighter or a brand, you’re well on your way to building a community more likely to engage in your content.

It's the latest in a series of driverless development partnerships announced by tech companies and carmakers. On Wednesday,  Honda   ( HMC )  and  General Motors   ( GM )  said they were teaming up to create a new generation of fully autonomous vehicles. BMW   ( BMWYY )  has joined the board of Apollo, an autonomous driving project from Chinese internet firm  Baidu   ( BIDU ) . Facebook under investigation:  The Irish Data Protection Commission has launched a formal probe into a  Facebook   ( FB )  hack that affected as many as 50 million accounts. The commission will investigate whether the company complied with its obligations under new European data protection laws that came into effect in May. Facebook said last week that it closed the loophole, but 90 million users were forcefully logged out of their accounts as a precaution. Irish regulators are investigating because Facebook's international headquarters is in Dublin. There are still many unanswered questions about the hack: Who carried it out? US hiring data published Wednesday was stronger than expected, and momentum could continue Thursday if initial claims numbers add to the optimism. ""The underlying message is that the US economy isn't just in fine fettle, it's on fire,"" said Kit Juckes, strategist at Societe Generale. This new initiative will focus on the single biggest financial story of our generation: how technology is upending every corner of the global economy, forcing businesses, workers, and society itself to adapt rapidly, or be left behind.

Casually asking your smart fridge for relationship advice may seem dystopian now, but people may change their minds if such advice ends up saving their marriage.

After all, people do listen to their virtual friends. The Replika incident, as well as a lot of experimental lab research, shows that humans can and will become emotionally attached to bots. The science also demonstrates that people, in their eagerness to socialize, will happily disclose personal information to an artificial agent and will even shift their beliefs and behavior.

READ MORE This story is from the  WIRED World in 2024 , our annual trends briefing. For example, for a large language model (LLM) to generate humanlike text, it is important the model is fed huge volumes of data that somehow represents human language, interaction, and communication. Current LLMs, for instance, have now entered an era of trillion-parameter machine-learning models, which means that they require billion-sized data sets. This web-sourced data is assumed to capture “ground truth” for human communication and interaction, a proxy from which language can be modeled on. Although various researchers have now shown that online data sets are often of  poor quality , tend to  exacerbate negative stereotypes , and contain problematic content such as  racial slurs  and  hateful speech , often towards marginalized groups, this hasn’t stopped the big AI companies from using such data in the race to scale up. With generative AI, this problem is about to get a lot worse. It is difficult, if not impossible—even with state-of-the-art detection tools—to know for sure how much text, image, audio, and video data is being generated currently and at what pace. The worrying thing is that these vast quantities of generative AI outputs will, in turn, be used as training material for future generative AI models. Soon, we will be trapped in a recursive loop where we will be training AI models using only synthetic data produced by AI models. Unfortunately, this will also be the data that we will use to train generative models applied to high-stake sectors including medicine, therapy, education, and law.

Researchers from Columbia University recently described a similar phenomenon in neurons. It's possible, then, that this kind of immune trickery is more common than anyone thought.","“The cell is effectively dressing up as an infectious agent,” Kagan said. “The result is that it convinces itself that it’s infected, and then operates as such.” Simmering Immunity Immune responses can be destructive, and antiviral responses especially so. Because viruses are at their most dangerous when they’re already inside a cell, most immune strategies that target viral infections work in part by damaging and killing infected cells. For that reason, cells cry “Virus!” at their own risk. In experiments with mice, Totary-Jain’s team found that the placenta’s double-stranded RNAs and ensuing immune response didn’t seem to hurt the developing embryos. Instead they protected the embryos from Zika virus infection. Typically the first responders to double-stranded Alu RNA escapees are type I and type II interferons, which quickly recruit destructive immune cells to the site of an infection, leading to tissue damage and even autoimmune disease. It acts locally by communicating only with cells within the tissue, generating a milder immune response—one that can be sustained long term in the placenta. How placental cells manage to activate only interferon lambda, keeping the immune response simmering but never boiling over, is still a mystery. But Totary-Jain has an idea about why placental cells evolved this trick that other cells seemingly avoid: Since the placenta is discarded at birth, perhaps it can afford to take immune risks that other tissues can’t. However, this trick—a low-level immune response generated by a fake virus—may not be limited to the placenta. Researchers from Columbia University recently described a similar phenomenon in neurons. They observed RNAs from different genomic elements  bound together  in double strands to produce an immune response. It’s possible, then, that this kind of immune trickery is more common than anyone thought.

Most Popular Politics Rumble Is Part of an ‘Active and Ongoing’ SEC Investigation William Turton Gear WIRED’s Favorite ‘Buy It for Life’ Gear Parker Hall Ocobock’s wintery work  began a decade ago, when she was a graduate student traveling to Wyoming to collect data from students of the nonprofit National Outdoor Leadership School. She hoped these measurements could help her predict the poorly understood energy demands that cold environments place on human bodies. But in other cases, people were losing a lot of muscle mass and coming back feeling horrible,” she says. So after Wyoming, Ocobock began a project with reindeer herders in Finland that include the Sámi, an Indigenous group. Worth the wait, she felt, since scientists still knew little about how bodies respond to extreme cold. Thirty years after Bergmann, American ornithologist Joel Asaph Allen tacked “shorter appendages” onto the theory of larger bodies. Our bodies make their own vitamin D out of a precursor chemical, 7-dehydrocholesterol, that absorbs UV-B rays from sunlight. In fact, the risk is  too much  cancer-causing sunlight, so people have more melanin, a skin pigment that absorbs UV. But as frigid climates get less sun, melanin competes with 7-dehydrocholesterol for weaker sunlight, so the body risks underproducing vitamin D. Experts believe this prompted ancient humans who lived in northern latitudes to develop lighter skin tones,  which synthesize vitamin D faster , an adaptation to life far from the equator. That same hair sample also showed genetic signs of high body-mass index, which is another adaptation to cold. Last year, Ocobock reported that brown fat speeds up the metabolisms of Finnish reindeer herders by  about 9 percent  when they feel cold. That means brown fat may also play an  indirect  role for heating, such as releasing fuel or signaling molecules to other organs.

The airport’s average subsidence rate is 1.7 millimeters a year (similar to the LaGuardia and Newark airports), but across JFK that varies between 0.8 and 2.8 millimeters a year, depending on the exact spot. Courtesy of Leonard O Ohenhen This sort of differential subsidence can also bork much smaller structures, like buildings, where one side might drop faster than another. “Even if that is just a few millimeters per year, you can potentially cause cracks along structures,” says Ohenhen. The study finds that subsidence is highly variable along the Atlantic Coast, both regionally and locally, as different stretches have different geology and topography, and different rates of groundwater extraction. It’s looking particularly problematic for several communities, like Virginia Beach, where 451,000 people and 177,000 properties are at risk. In Baltimore, Maryland, it’s 826,000 people and 335,000 properties, while in NYC—in Queens, Bronx, and Nassau—that leaps to 5 million people and 1.8 million properties. So there’s two components to addressing the problem of subsidence: Getting high-resolution data like in this study, and then pairing that with groundwater data. “Subsidence is so spatially variable,” says Snider. “Having the details of where groundwater extraction is really having an impact, and being able to then demonstrate that we need to change our management of that water, that reduces subsidence in the future.” The time to act is now, Shirzaei emphasizes. Facing down subsidence is like treating a disease: You spend less money by diagnosing and treating the problem now, saving money later by avoiding disaster. “This kind of data and the study could be an essential component of the health care system for infrastructure management,” he says. “Like cancers—if you diagnose it early on, it can be curable.

The 51-year-old revealed that she was diagnosed in early December 2023 with stage 2 cribriform carcinoma breast cancer,  exclusively to People . After gaining 25 pounds in three months, feeling “terrible pain” in her left breast and a lump during a self-exam, she decided to make an appointment with her doctor. “It really was throbbing and hurting,” she told People. “I immediately went to my general practitioner and she told me I had to immediately go get it looked at. But the problem was I just couldn’t get an appointment. Eggert appeared as a lifeguard for two seasons on the hit television series “Baywatch.”  Fremantle Media/Shutterstock After a mammogram and three biopsies, Eggert’s pathology reports tested positive for cancer. This hasn’t been a breezy sale through life,” she admits, noting that she’s been trying to stay positive. “I always read inspirational quotes and corny stuff, but it gets me through.” Eggert, who appeared as a lifeguard for two seasons on the hit series, which also starred Pamela Anderson and David Hasselhoff, will undergo surgery to remove the cancer. Fremantle Media/Shutterstock “I can definitely feel it,” she says of the lump in her breast. “The Celebrity Fit Club” alum is unsure if the cancer has spread to other parts of her body and if her oncologist will prescribe chemotherapy and radiation before therapy. It’s growing, and you’re just like, you just want it out.” Both of Eggert’s parents battled cancer in their lifetimes  — her father battled skin cancer and mother battled colon cancer —  and she fears not being there for her children, daughters Keegan, 12, and Dilyn, 25, whom she shares with ex-husband Justin Herwick. “It immediately made me realize, there’s just no succumbing to this.

Print     It seems anywhere scientists look for plastic, they find it: from the ice in Antarctica, to the first bowel movement produced by newborn babies. Now, researchers are finding that the amount of microscopic plastics floating in bottled drinking water is far greater than initially believed. “For a long time before this study, I actually thought that what was inside bottled water [in terms of] nanoplastics was just a few hundred PET particles,” said Naixin Qian, a Columbia chemistry graduate student and the study’s lead author. “It turns out to be much more than that.” PET, or polyethylene terephthalate, is a type of clear plastic that is commonly used for single-use water bottles. As a result, Yan said, “even if they’re not that toxic at a larger particle size, when they become smaller they become toxic, because they can interfere in the cells, in the tissues, inside of the organelles.”   Advertisement   Research on the effects of plastic on human health is still in its infancy. In some cases, the particles are ingested with food and water. “As people, we are in environments where plastic is everywhere,”  Yan said. There’s also evidence  that these small particles bioaccumulate, or grow more concentrated as they move up the food chain from one organism to the next. Plastic chemicals and nanoplastics “are part of the same problem, but they’re two totally different animals,” said James E. Rogers, a microbiologist who is acting director of product safety at Consumer Reports. Both phthalates and bisphenols are known endocrine disruptors, meaning they interfere with the body’s hormonal systems. Exposure to these chemicals over time is associated with higher risks of diabetes, obesity, cancers and fertility problems, Rogers said. “You may not be able to get to zero exposure, but at least you can reduce your risk by reducing your exposure,” Rogers said. Eat less fatty food.” Now that they’ve grossed us out about bottled water, the Columbia team are looking at how else they can use stimulated Raman scattering microscopy to seek out nanoplastics in other areas of life.

Print     As global carbon emissions from human activity hit an  all-time high  last year, my family zeroed out emissions from our home and cars while getting an 11% tax-free return on the investment. I spent my career in the Department of Energy’s  National Laboratory system  researching how to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions. I know that a  third  of U.S. energy-related emissions come from homes and personal vehicles. Since our property is shaded by grand, carbon-storing redwoods, on-site solar wasn’t an option. Quite the contrary: Our energy bills for home and cars fell by about $11,000 per year. After reporting lower-than-advertised driving range in our first electric vehicle, I was ghosted by customer support, later learning that I may have been among the thousands shunted to a secret “ diversion team ” to deflect such complaints. Most were skeptical, ignoring juicy rebates and tax credits; sometimes their errors or lack of skill increased project costs. Thanks to such factors, alongside incentives under President Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act, it would actually have cost more to install a conventional gas furnace and water heater than the high-performance and climate-friendly electric heat pump system that does both jobs. After incentives, our EV purchase costs were  on par  with those of comparable gas cars. Thanks to the lower rates, our home’s total electricity bills didn’t go up at all. As the visionary physicist Amory Lovins has long  said , energy efficiency is not only a free lunch, but one you’re paid to eat. Eliminating our 27-ton annual carbon-dioxide footprint — equal to the yearly  emissions  of around 15 high-performing  hybrid cars  — is another welcome return on investment. Fortunately, the  U.S. government  and  NGOs  are stepping up green workforce development, a pressing need if our nation is to meet decarbonization targets.

Oceanographers have now discovered what appears to be a massive dumping ground of military weaponry. “Who knew that right in our backyard, the more you look, the more you find.”        Scripps researchers were able to group most of the military waste that they found underwater into four general categories: munition boxes, smoke floats, and two types of WWII-era depth charges. (UC San Diego Scripps Institution of Oceanography)   Among the munitions documented were Hedgehog and Mark 9 depth charges — explosives that were typically dropped from warships to attack submarines. Advertisement   These findings, made public Friday, build on a stunning 2021  underwater sonar survey  that identified tens of thousands of barrel-like objects between Los Angeles and Catalina Island. Discarding military waste at sea was not uncommon in decades past, but this once-forgotten history of ocean dumping continues to haunt our environment today. Dozens of marine scientists and ecotoxicologists have since  convened regularly  to discuss the data gaps in our understanding of DDT, a pesticide (banned in 1972) that was largely manufactured in Los Angeles and was so powerful it poisoned birds and fish. Gavin Newsom also boosted further research with an additional  $5.6 million. “What’s scary — as if we needed it to be more scary — is that we’re now up to more than 100 square miles of contamination from this dumpsite, with high DDT concentrations at depths that nobody’s even ever looked before, and now we’re seeing all the other stuff that was dumped as well,” he said. “And it’s only what we see, from the standpoint of big munitions, as opposed to: How do we know there weren’t other chemicals that were dumped by the Department of Defense?” David Valentine, the UC Santa Barbara scientist whose marine research team  first came across  dozens of eerie-looking barrels, also emphasized that the less-visible pollution is more cause for concern. Advertisement   On the most recent expedition, a crew of nine Scripps researchers and  10 specialists from the Navy’s Supervisor of Salvage scanned the seafloor for more than 300 hours — capturing as many images as possible with high-resolution technology not typically available to scientists. Advanced sonar readings pinpointed potentially more than 60 whale falls, and researchers were able to visually confirm seven with their camera system.

Three-quarters of global deforestation is driven by agriculture. The European Union’s regulation on deforestation-free supply chains imposes trade embargoes on products such as palm oil.","Sharma   Jan. 5, 2024  3 AM PT    Share   Facebook   Twitter   LinkedIn   Email   Copy Link URL Copied! According to a recent  report  from the World Wildlife Fund, 6.6 million hectares of forest were lost in 2022. It’s a mind-boggling statistic, especially since  it represents  21% more forest cover than  should have been lost that year to keep pace  to end deforestation by 2030 — a  pledge from   the 2021 United Nations climate conference (COP26 )  in Glasgow, Scotland. At last year’s COP28 in Dubai,  world leaders renewed their pledge to reverse deforestation. In 2022, the world lost  more than 11 soccer fields  of tropical forest per minute. Environmental crises are for many people an abstraction, and so can seem their repercussions. That chain of events has been tied to  Ebola  flare-ups in Central and West Africa and the upswing of  Lyme  disease in the northeastern United States. And it harms animals too: In subtropical parts of Australia where  forests are blithely cleared , bats experience  profound stress  from human-induced land change. Forests have traditionally functioned as “carbon sinks.” The Earth’s trees absorb  more than 7 billion  metric tons of carbon dioxide — about a fifth of what the  world lets out into its atmosphere  — and release it back as oxygen or bind it into sugars that form their roots, branches and leaves. Advertisement   Then there’s evidence showing the extent to which forests influence our mental health. In the 1980s, Japan even pioneered a form of therapy around trees: s hinrin-yoku,  also known as “forest bathing,” which seeks to harness psychologically restorative effects from being outdoors. But researchers found that  subsidizing a local clinic  to make healthcare more affordable and accessible reduced this problem. Ultimately, however,  three-quarters  of global deforestation is driven by agriculture — a reality that calls for ambitious legislation. The European Union’s  regulation on deforestation-free supply chains  imposes trade embargoes on products such as palm oil, cattle and soy that are frequently produced on illegally deforested lands, and in the U.S., the  FOREST Act  is a bipartisan bill that would take a similar approach. What remains to be seen is if they’ll be able to see the forest from the trees and produce real change rather than an empty promise.",2024-01-05 11:00:16,"[0.006031512909061671, 0.021836845423017733, 0.005813735686778517, 0.004324455738477403, 0.005087973868534373, 0.002117866343873094, 0.9829977175253365, 0.004046579136615999, 0.025198490636425114, 0.005179275554141254, 0.1795705528604749, 0.004147053487345546, 0.012195511498765703, 0.005450822110631656]",,Opinion-Why-disappearing-trees-are-so-bad-for-our-climate--and-health.wav

The move by the left to erase history and get rid of the memory of so many historical figures is not robbing future generations of knowing their past, but perverting it in the present.","Screenshot/EndWokeness X This is almost too unbelievable to be true, but unfortunately has become a seemingly permanent movement in our country the last few years. Under the Biden administration, the National Park Service has announced the statue of William Penn in a Philadelphia park that commemorates his founding of Pennsylvania will be removed. This statue sits at Penn’s former home, and will be replaced with more “inclusive” items. RELATED: George Stephanopoulos: There’s ‘No Way’ the Supreme Court Allows States To Ban Trump From Ballots You’ve Got to Be Kidding The National Park Service Claims the removal is all about “rehabilitation.” Rehabilitation of what, exactly? Fox News  reports,  “The ‘rehabilitation’ proposal for Welcome Park is meant to ‘provide a more welcoming, accurate, and inclusive experience for visitors,’ NPS said in a news release. So they are canceling William Penn now because he’s evil, racist, white… or whatever. “Leave the statue right where it is,” one X user wrote in response to Independence National Historical Park’s tweet. The online disdain for this idea kept rolling. One user noted that name of the park where Penn’s statue is located, is called ‘Welcome Park.’ Unless you’re an American of European descent, it seems.

Bryant: “If it wasn’t the fact there’d be a lot of people sitting in jail right now.”,"Opinion Investigative Journalist Nick Bryant Tells Roger Stone DOJ And FBI ‘Obviously’ Aiding And Abetting Child Trafficking After Epstein Documents Released Bryant, who first discovered and published contents of Epstein’s “little black book” on  Gawker in 2015 , stated his belief that the intelligence community helped cover up the crimes of those involved with the convicted pedophile and sex trafficker. There’s a dark malignant corner of our intelligence that is aiding and abetting child trafficking,” Bryant said. I mean, if it wasn’t the fact there’d be a lot of people sitting in jail right now.” RELATED:  Court Documents: Bill Clinton ‘Likes Them Young,’ Is ‘Key Person’ Who Can Provide Information On Jeffrey Epstein This isn’t the first time that we’ve heard some sort of insinuation that the Justice Department and the FBI have helped cover those involved with Epstein over the years. As Bryant states, if there  weren’t  an ongoing and complex cover-up, Epstein – who was convicted of procuring for prostitution a girl below the age of 18 in 2008 and  was facing sex trafficking  charges until he died allegedly by suicide in a Manhattan jail cell in 2019 –  and Ghislaine Maxwell – who is currently serving 20 years in prison for her involvement in the late billionaire pedophile’s crimes – wouldn’t be the only people who served prison time for these crimes against children. Representative Tim Burchett (R-TN) echoed Bryant’s comments prior to the Jeffrey Epstein document release, adding that the intelligence community and members of Congress are “ compromised ” into not providing public information on the notorious sex predator. After stating his assertion that he is “one hundred percent” certain lawmakers are compromised, Burchett proceeded to slam “unelected bureaucrats” in the intelligence community who have, in his estimation, taken part in other efforts to keep information out of the public square. The congressman claimed “somebody in power” had Epstein killed as a “diversion” to take focus off of former President Bill Clinton. RELATED:  Joe Rogan: Epstein Kept That Painting Of Bill Clinton In A Dress To Let Him Know ‘I Got You B****’ Calls For A Truth And Reconciliation Commission Clinton is the most prominent name to have appeared in the Epstein document dump, with perhaps the only exception being Prince Andrew. This is despite the fact that the media, as Stone points out, tries desperately to portray a level of false equivalence with former President Donald Trump’s name appearing in the documents. “If anything, I think there’s a measure of exoneration (for Trump) in these new releases,” Stone asserts. “We don’t know how many times (Clinton was on the island) and that’s the thing about a Truth and Reconciliation Commission is that we’ve got to know these things,” Bryant told Stone. “We have to know what politicians were on that island, what politicians molested these girls.” “If we don’t do that now I believe that that behavior is just going to continue and our government is going to become more perfidious and corrupt,” he added.

This was likely a reference to her role as Jean Milburn on ""Sex Education"" Anderson previously portrayed the conservative former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher on ""The Crown""","Opinion Gillian Anderson Wears Vagina-Covered Dress To Golden Globes – ‘So Many Reasons’ Anderson’s Vagina Dress “It has vaginas on it,” Anderson said, adding that she chose to wear this dress for “so many reasons.” “It’s brand appropriate,” she stated with a smirk. This was likely a reference to Anderson portraying Jean Milburn, a sex therapist and overbearing mother to teenage  son Otis Milburn (Asa Butterfield) on “Sex Education.” This show featured Anderson’s character hosting vagina workshops and having vulva-inspired art throughout her home, according to  USA Today . “During the first season of the show, because there were so many great props in Jean’s house that looked like penises and yonis. I took lots of pictures of them while we were filming and the girl who helped me with social media said, ‘I think you might get banned.’ We weren’t sure if putting up penis pictures would backfire, but so far it’s been alright,” Anderson told  British Vogue  in January of 2020, referring to her “#yonioftheday” and “#penisoftheday” series’ on social media. “Now people send me stuff that they’ve seen – shadows, plants, basically anything that looks like a penis or yoni,” Anderson continued. “Sometimes it can be hard to capture them, like if you’re in a cab going through London and you see something. I haven’t gotten to a point yet when I’m like, ‘Stop the cab!’ But I guess I might.” Related:  Kevin Costner ‘Grateful’ To Attend Golden Globes After Bitter Divorce Battle Anderson Completes Her Look People Magazine  reported that Anderson completed her look last night “with plenty of Chopard jewels, including an 18k white gold necklace with a 10-carat pear-shaped yellow diamond and nearly 30 carats of diamonds, earrings in 18k yellow gold and 18k white gold with four pear-shaped yellow diamonds totaling 15 carats of yellow diamonds and a pair of white diamonds totaling .50-carats and a bracelet in 18k white gold with 13 carats of diamonds and a ring in 18k yellow gold set with diamonds.” Anderson’s Margaret Thatcher Portrayal Anderson previously portrayed the conservative former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher on “The Crown,” telling   Harper’s Bazaar  in 2020 that she tried to portray her as a “human being.” “I had to get to a point where it’s nothing to do with my opinions of her policies, of her actions,” she said at the time. “It is only about her as a human being and her motivation as a politician and as a mother.” Related:  ‘The View’ Hosts Gush Over Full-Frontal Nude Dating Show ‘Naked Attraction’ In a 2021 interview, Anderson opened up about her disdain for bras.

But DES won't be able to provide that; the survey stopped taking data in January 2019. But spectra are hard to acquire, requiring lots of observing time on the largest telescopes, which will be impractical for future dark energy surveys like the Legacy Survey of Space and Time, LSST, to be conducted at the Vera C. Rubin Observatory, operated jointly by NSF's NOIRLab and DOE's SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory. Among the data from about two million distant observed galaxies, DES found several thousand supernovae.

Mice programmed to have this communication pathway constantly open lived longer. With less use, nervous system wiring throughout the white adipose tissue gradually retracts. This leads to fat accumulation, weight gain and less energy to fuel brain and other tissues.","A new study from Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis identifies, in mice, a critical communication pathway connecting the brain and the body's fat tissue in a feedback loop that appears central to energy production throughout the body. Using genetic and molecular methods, the researchers studied mice that were programmed to have this communication pathway constantly open after they reached a certain age. The scientists found that these mice were more physically active, showed signs of delayed aging, and lived longer than mice in which this same communication pathway gradually slowed down as part of normal aging. ""We demonstrated a way to delay aging and extend healthy life spans in mice by manipulating an important part of the brain,"" said senior author Shin-ichiro Imai, MD, PhD, the Theodore and Bertha Bryan Distinguished Professor in Environmental Medicine and a professor in the Department of Developmental Biology at Washington University. ""Showing this effect in a mammal is an important contribution to the field; past work demonstrating an extension of life span in this way has been conducted in less complex organisms, such as worms and fruit flies."" The fight or flight response is well known for having broad effects throughout the body, including causing increased heart rate and slowed digestion. With less use, the nervous system wiring throughout the white adipose tissue gradually retracts, and what was once a dense network of interconnecting nerves becomes sparse. The fat tissues no longer receive as many signals to release fatty acids and eNAMPT, which leads to fat accumulation, weight gain and less energy to fuel the brain and other tissues. The researchers, including first author Kyohei Tokizane, PhD, a staff scientist and a former postdoctoral researcher in Imai's lab, found that when they used genetic methods in old mice to keep Ppp1r17 in the nucleus of the neurons in the hypothalamus, the mice were more physically active -- with increased wheel-running -- and lived longer than control mice. They also used a technique to directly activate these specific neurons in the hypothalamus of old mice, and they observed similar anti-aging effects. On average, the high end of the life span of a typical laboratory mouse is about 900 to 1,000 days, or about 2.5 years. That translates into an increase in life span of about 7%. The mice receiving the interventions also were more active and looked younger -- with thicker and shinier coats -- at later ages, suggesting more time with better health as well. ""We can envision a possible anti-aging therapy that involves delivering eNAMPT in various ways,"" Imai said. We look forward to continuing our work investigating ways to maintain this central feedback loop between the brain and the body's fat tissues in ways that we hope will extend health and life span.""",2024-01-08 22:25:34,"[0.0061202863097483936, 0.011107206693005493, 0.007182696735984704, 0.0033822237842346383, 0.005797881281439016, 0.0029024399493134804, 0.13031372150634274, 0.0025417389895476534, 0.0067429526841100585, 0.0034122215684717575, 0.9912575764715152, 0.004220015846589954, 0.008118271041658366, 0.0036833425493146502]",,Life-span-increases-in-mice-when-specific-brain-cells-are-activated.wav

""Our research is an important step toward more practical solid state batteries for industrial and commercial applications."" Plating on the anode creates an uneven, non-homogeneous surface, like plaque on teeth, and allows dendrites to take root. When discharged, that plaque-like coating needs to be stripped from the anode and when plating is uneven, the stripping process can be slow and result in potholes that induce even more uneven plating in the next charge. In 2021, Li and his team offered one way to deal with dendrites by designing a multilayer battery that sandwiched different materials of varying stabilities between the anode and cathode. This multilayer, multi-material design prevented the penetration of lithium dendrites not by stopping them altogether, but rather by controlling and containing them. In this new research, Li and his team stop dendrites from forming by using micron-sized silicon particles in the anode to constrict the lithiation reaction and facilitate homogeneous plating of a thick layer of lithium metal. These coated particles create a homogenous surface across which the current density is evenly distributed, preventing the growth of dendrites. And, because plating and stripping can happen quickly on an even surface, the battery can recharge in only about 10 minutes. They then defined a unique property descriptor to describe such a process and computed it for all known inorganic materials. In doing so, the team revealed dozens of other materials that could potentially yield similar performance.

Toxicity studies were just guessing what's in there,"" said study coauthor Beizhan Yan, an environmental chemist at Columbia University's Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory. Unlike natural organic matter, most plastics do not break down into relatively benign substances; they simply divide and redivide into smaller and smaller particles of the same chemical composition. Beyond single molecules, there is no theoretical limit to how small they can get. ""People developed methods to see nano particles, but they didn't know what they were looking at,"" said the new study's lead author, Naixin Qian, a Columbia graduate student in chemistry. This involves probing samples with two simultaneous lasers that are tuned to make specific molecules resonate. The researchers tested three popular brands of bottled water sold in the United States (they declined to name which ones), analyzing plastic particles down to just 100 nanometers in size. This was not surprising, since that is what many water bottles are made of. Ironically, said Beizhan Yan, that probably comes from plastic filters used to supposedly purify the water before it is bottled. Other common plastics the researchers found: polystyrene, polyvinyl chloride and polymethyl methacrylate, all used in various industrial processes.

All of these species have declined at rates suggesting that they may now be globally threatened. Several other familiar, widespread raptor species are now scarce or absent from unprotected land. Dr Phil Shaw commented: ""Since the 1970s, extensive areas of forest and savanna have been converted into farmland, while other pressures affecting African raptors have likewise intensified. In many areas we have watched these species nearly disappear. There's no single threat imperiling these birds, it's a combination of many human-caused ones, in other words we are seeing deaths from a thousand cuts."" Professor Ian Newton OBE FRS, FRSE, a world-leading ornithologist who was not involved in the study, commented: ""This is an important paper which draws attention to the massive declines in predatory birds which have occurred across much of Africa during recent decades. This was the continent over which, only 50 years ago, pristine populations of spectacular raptors were evident almost everywhere, bringing excitement and wonder to visitors from many parts of the world. The causes of the declines are many -- from rampant habitat destruction to growing use of poisons by farmers and poachers and expanding powerline networks -- all ultimately due to expansions in human numbers, livestock grazing and other activities. Raptors of all sizes lead an increasingly perilous existence on Africa's unprotected land, where suitable habitat, food supplies and breeding sites have been drastically reduced, and persecution from pastoralists, ivory poachers and farmers is now widespread. Some raptors that occur mostly in West Africa, such as the little-known Beaudouin's Snake-eagle, are vanishing into oblivion.""

It launched towards the moon aboard the  Vulcan rocket  on 8 January, but just seven hours after the launch it started experiencing “anomalies” that may prevent it from landing safely on the moon. The first hint of a problem was that the spacecraft was unable to reorient itself so that its solar panels pointed at the sun. The engineering team on the ground was able to command the craft to manoeuvre and face the right direction so its batteries could charge. Those batteries power Peregrine’s communications and scientific instruments, which seem to be working fine for now. But that isn’t the end of the problem. The thrusters intended to carry Peregrine to the moon and land it safely are powered by rocket fuel, which seems to be leaking. In a series of short  statements , Astrobotic stated that the issue is “causing a critical loss of propellant” and “[this] propulsion anomaly, if proven true, threatens the ability of the spacecraft to soft land on the moon.” The first image sent back by the spacecraft shows billowing insulation in the foreground, hinting that whatever caused the fuel leak may have also disrupted the craft’s insulation. Advertisement If Peregrine cannot land on the moon, it is unclear which, if any, of its science objectives it will be able to accomplish, even though its battery is fully charged. “The team is working to try and stabilise this [propellant] loss, but given the situation, we have prioritised maximising the science and data we can capture,” the statements said. “We are currently assessing what alternative mission profiles may be feasible at this time.” Astrobotic did not respond immediately to a request for comment. Assuming that Peregrine will not be able to land, this marks the third failed attempt in a row by a private company to land on the moon – the  Beresheet lander  crashed to the lunar surface in 2019, and the  Hakuto-R lander  did the same in 2023.

Of the 5600 or so confirmed exoplanets, the researchers calculated that more than 1900 could have diamond rain.","Diamond rain may fall on a large number of exoplanets Shutterstock The skies of icy planets across the cosmos may be full of diamonds. Compressed carbon compounds can turn into diamonds at less extreme temperatures than researchers thought were required, which may make diamond rain a common phenomenon inside ice giants. In the past, laboratory experiments have led to confusion about the conditions under which  diamonds could form  inside ice giants such as Uranus and Neptune. There are two types of experiments investigating this: dynamic compression experiments, in which carbon compounds are subjected to a sudden shock, and static compression experiments, in which they are placed inside a chamber and compressed gradually. So far, dynamic compression experiments have required much higher temperatures and pressures to form diamonds. Advertisement Mungo Frost  at the SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory in California and his colleagues performed a new set of experiments using static compression but dynamic heating, compressing polystyrene – the same polymer used to make Styrofoam – by  squeezing it between two diamonds  and then hitting it with pulses of X-ray light. They observed diamonds beginning to form from the polystyrene at temperatures of about 2200°C and pressures around 19 gigapascals, conditions similar to those in the shallow interiors of Uranus and Neptune. These pressures are much lower than the pressures found to be necessary for diamond formation in earlier experiments using dynamic compression. The reaction took longer than dynamic compression experiments typically run, which might explain why such experiments haven’t picked up low-pressure diamond formation. “It disagreed with established results and wasn’t what we expected to see, but it fit in nicely and sort of tied everything together,” says Frost. “It turns out that was all down to different timescales.” This could mean that diamond rain is possible on smaller planets than we previously thought. Of the 5600 or so confirmed exoplanets, the researchers calculated that more than 1900 could have diamond rain. It also means that within the solar system, diamonds could form at shallower depths than we thought, which could change our understanding of the dynamics of the interiors of giant planets. This shallower formation could allow the diamond rain to pass through a layer of ice as it sinks towards the centres of these planets.

Beginning in 2019, on her first mission to the  International Space Station  (ISS), the  NASA astronaut  lived in space for 328 days – the longest time any woman has spent there. During that mission, she 3D printed biological tissues, grew proteins, worked on a dark matter experiment and made up half of  the first all-female spacewalk . Now, as part of the space agency’s ambitious project to send people back to the moon, Koch is getting ready for her next adventure. With it, she will cement her place in the history books. On the Artemis II mission, scheduled for November, Koch will spend 10 days on a trip to circle the moon  with three other astronauts . Doing this will probably mean she won’t get to set foot on the lunar surface in the future, however, due to the lifetime safety limits on how long an astronaut can spend in space. Nevertheless, she will become the first woman to orbit Earth’s satellite and set eyes on its mysterious far side.

Advertisement If that were the case, Raskin  argued on CNN  Tuesday evening, a president could literally get away with murder. He said, “As a member of Congress, my first thought was, ’Well, then if the president is going to order out for the assassination of his political rivals and say, there’s a narrow margin in the Senate of two or three votes in the opposition party. Advertisement Echoing  many other legal experts , Raskin panned the argument, describing it as “utterly ludicrous.” “Nobody has ever even attempted such an absurd argument in American history, but it shows you how outlandish and deranged  Donald Trump ’s worldview is at this point,” he said. Trump is seeking to have his federal election subversion case thrown out on the basis of presidential immunity, though it’s unlikely he will be successful, given the reactions of the appeals panel judges. When asked by one judge if a president could face prosecution if he had assassinated a political rival but not been impeached, Trump’s attorney gave a “qualified yes ― if he is impeached and convicted first.” Support HuffPost The Stakes Have Never Been Higher At HuffPost, we believe that everyone needs high-quality journalism, but we understand that not everyone can afford to pay for expensive news subscriptions.

The way she made it sound was really that we were thoughtful partners to her,” Hoffer said. “The first thing I thought about was, wow, this woman actually recognized [that] without all those requests answered, and somebody pushing along her intent and her goal, there would have been a stop, or there would have been a delay, or there would have been someone missing, or whatever it was she was trying to gain for the success of everybody,” Hoffer said. “Many view this role as a stepping stone, but there are a majority of us who view this as our life’s work and we love it,” said  Lindsay Robinson , an executive assistant at LinkedIn.

To call him the world’s most dominant athlete, which he was, only undersold his broader significance.","T he announcement that Tiger Woods and Nike have  called time on their 27-year commercial partnership  came as no surprise to anyone who has been paying close attention. It has been nearly a decade since Nike, which  said in a recent earnings call  it will seek $2bn in cost savings over the next three years,  stopped making golf equipment , including balls, clubs and bags. Indeed, Phil Knight spent three years aggressively recruiting Woods based on the Jordan proof of concept: that a single charismatic sportsperson touched with divine gifts could shoulder an entire sports-entertainment empire. Woods soon delivered a return on investment that far exceeded the initial terms of $40m over five years. To call him the world’s most dominant athlete, which he was, only undersold his broader significance. He was larger than life, the rare chosen one who not only met but surpassed all expectations and held the world in his thrall, winning majors by record margins and conjuring one unforgettable moment after another. Never , which debuted before the 2008 US Open (where he would stage  an extraordinary 19th-hole playoff win ), relied on a voiceover from Tiger’s father, Earl, who had died of cancer two years previously. Even at their most overwrought – like the famed  I Am Tiger Woods  spot, which borrowed liberally from the coda of Spike Lee’s 1993 magnum opus  Malcolm X  – they were earnest enough in their hyperbole to succeed. People got excited when a new Tiger ad dropped, an enthusiasm only boosted by their scarcity in a pre-YouTube age, when happening across it on television was the only way of seeing it. Traditional network TV audiences were fragmenting even before getting splintered to oblivion by the ascent of streaming services. In 2018, longtime  Nike  athlete Roger Federer – one of the few sports stars whose association with a brand felt as permanent as Woods – left Nike after 24 years for the Japanese clothing retail chain Uniqlo on a 10-year, $300m contract.

The Aussies are expected to be a force to be reckoned with in Qatar. But will they be able to go beyond the quarter-final stage? And will they have met a reasonable level of expectations?,"A s Australia prepares to compete in its fifth  Asian Cup , commencing against India on Saturday evening, so too arrive the inevitable questions that come with these tournaments. Just how far can they go once the action begins in Qatar? And at what point will they have met a reasonable level of expectations? In truth, it’s difficult to slap an exact projection on them; they can’t be said to exist at the same level of expectation as Japan or South Korea, but they’re still capable of winning the tournament if everything breaks in the right manner for them. They are able to delight or disappoint often in the same game, let alone across a tournament. Add to this injury problems (Mat Leckie, Denis Genreau), retirements (Aaron Mooy, Tom Rogić, Massimo Luongo), club wilderness (Ajdin Hrustić, Fran Karačić), and the complications of this tournament taking place during European club seasons (Alex Robertson, Alessandro Circati), and picking a 26-player squad has proven complicated. Harry Souttar, Jordan Bos, Connor Metcalfe and Riley McGree are players that shape as foundational contributors for the 2026 cycle. They’re being supplemented by a veteran core of figures such as Jackson Irvine, Craig Goodwin and Mat Ryan that Arnold trusts to help him progress beyond the quarter-final stage of this tournament. And if we’re making historical callbacks, there exists a level of serendipity to this Asian Cup shifting to Qatar, given it was Australia’s accomplishments in Doha just over 12 months ago that served to reset many narratives around the team, and forced a re-examination of just what they could – and should – accomplish. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to  Australia Sport Free newsletter Get a daily roundup of the latest sports news, features and comment from our Australian sports desk Privacy Notice:  Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

When they meet in just eight days, it will be there too. By then Ancelotti will have faced Diego Simeone, neighbours in La Finca on the western edge of Madrid, as many times as any other coach in his 32-year career: that league fixture will be the 24th game they have come across each other from their technical areas.

Photograph: Juan Medina/Reuters Atlético meanwhile are different, too: they have scored more goals but the defensive solidity that used to define them has been absent, they have lost each of their past four away games and slipped 10 points behind in the league – enough to suggest that February’s meeting may be of little relevance, the title long since escaping their grasp.

The Argentine has struggled for players to rise to the top at the club. Boro are a reminder no club should expect to stay around forever. Teams can only play above themselves once they have been built for football.,"Nine years ago, when at Tottenham, reaching the League Cup final – and losing against Chelsea – helped to gain  Mauricio Pochettino  admirers among initially questioning supporters. This is probably a harder job, too, given the incoherence of Chelsea, where recruitment fulfils accounting principles before team-building. Beyond the Spurs fans, there used only to be Daniel Levy, not a room full of sporting directors and venture capitalists, each throwing around their own bright blue‑sky thinking. He is permitted a dip when others have never risen to any sort of prominence. Djordje Petrovic makes a save from Middlesbrough’s Emmanuel Latte Lath as Axel Disasi slides in desperately. Beyond Palmer, Thiago Silva and Raheem Sterling, Pochettino struggles for the lieutenants to whom he has always turned. But even among a fully fit squad, there would be no Adam Lallana, who hit his peak at Southampton, for example. Conor Gallagher could be a floppy-haired Dennis Wise type, if only club suits would stop looking at his book value.

Postal affairs minister Kevin Hollinrake said that hundreds fell victim to a ""brutal and arbitrary exercise of power"". There were more than 900 convictions linked to the scandal over 16 years. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak told the House of Commons that those previously convicted in England and Wales would be cleared of wrongdoing and compensated under a new law. The Scottish government also announced  similar plans  for those convicted in Scotland, which has a separate legal system. But the Department for Business told the BBC convictions would not be lifted until former sub-postmasters and postmistresses signed a declaration that they had not committed any crime. Wednesday's announcement comes after a fortnight in which a scandal that had played out largely in the wings was thrust centre stage by the ITV drama series. ""People abused us in the street for being thieves and my children were bullied,"" he said. Faults with the software meant it wrongly showed some sub-postmasters racking up losses, leading them to be accused of crimes like theft or false accounting - and losing their livelihoods and good names as a result. A public inquiry into the affair which was launched in 2021 is set to resume on Thursday. The firm has been awarded more than £6.5bn in public contracts since 2013, according to procurement analysts Tussell.

Israeli President Isaac Herzog called the accusations ""atrocious and preposterous""","16 minutes ago About sharing Police disperse protesters outside the ICJ in The Hague on Thursday By Anna Holligan, Hague correspondent & Oliver Slow in London BBC News The UN's International Court of Justice is hearing a case brought by South Africa accusing Israel of committing genocide against Palestinians in Gaza. There were angry scenes outside the ICJ's Peace Palace on Thursday as Dutch police struggled to keep groups of Palestinian and Israeli supporters apart. Hundreds of people waving Palestinian flags gathered outside the ICJ, calling for a ceasefire. In its submission, South Africa says Israel's actions ""are intended to bring about the destruction of a substantial part of the Palestinian national, racial and ethnical group"". It says  Israel's actions include ""killing Palestinians in Gaza, causing them serious bodily and mental harm, and inflicting on them conditions of life calculated to bring about their physical destruction"". It calls for ""provisional measures"" to be implemented by the court as a matter of urgency, including that Israel cease all military activities in Gaza. Israeli President Isaac Herzog called the accusations ""atrocious and preposterous"". He added that the Israeli army was ""doing its utmost under extremely complicated circumstances on the ground to make sure that there will be no unintended consequences and no civilian casualties"". The ICJ could rule quickly on South Africa's request for Israel to suspend its military campaign - but a final ruling on whether Israel is committing genocide could take years. He told the BBC that South Africa needs to ""demonstrate that there are elements that support its case"", for the court to issue an order, although this would not involve ""making a definite decision as to whether or not genocide is actually taking place"". South Africa has been highly critical of Israel's military operation in Gaza, and its governing African National Congress has a long history of solidarity with the Palestinian cause. In those attacks some 1,300 people were killed - mainly civilians - and about 240 others taken hostage.",2024-01-11 09:49:54,"[0.03958607274536563, 0.012286555843795385, 0.008601420121786224, 0.07597481520314248, 0.0220730552159852, 0.007454383338240027, 0.021066397758761204, 0.01625706778683991, 0.16614962919455403, 0.9810468172732331, 0.007674064810344872, 0.006124890948218151, 0.017075282540390393, 0.027173988567223653]",,UN-court-hears-South-Africa-genocide-case-against-Israel.wav

Eriksson, who had a 42-year career in management, stood down from his most recent role as sporting director at Swedish club Karlstad 11 months ago because of health issues. He then went on to enjoy two spells with Portuguese giants Benfica as well as Italian sides Roma, Fiorentina, Sampdoria and Lazio - where he won seven trophies including the Serie A title, two Italian Cups and the Uefa Cup Winners' Cup. During his time with England, Eriksson led the Three Lions to a famous  5-1 win against Germany  in Munich during qualifying for the 2002 World Cup, with Michael Owen scoring a hat-trick. Eriksson was in charge for two World Cup campaigns, exiting both the 2002 and 2006 editions at the quarter-final stage with Ronaldinho's long-range free kick helping Brazil beat England 2-1 in the former, while  Portugal prevailed on penalties  after Wayne Rooney had been sent off following an incident with his Manchester United team-mate Cristiano Ronaldo in the latter. He took the national side to just one European Championship in 2004 when it was Portugal again who sent England home with another penalty shootout victory in the last eight. After a five year stint, it was  announced in January 2006  that Eriksson was to leave his role following that summer's World Cup in Germany despite having two years left on his contract. No official reason was given for his departure at the time, though the Swede had come under pressure after being caught in a newspaper sting by a tabloid journalist. His years as England manager were marked by scandal over his private life, including newspapers revealing affairs with television presenter Ulrika Jonsson in 2002 and former Football Association secretary Faria Alam in 2004. Eriksson went on to have a varied managerial career following his England departure, including spells with Manchester City and Leicester City, along with roles with national sides Mexico, Ivory Coast and the Philippines. He also had a short spell as director of football at League Two side Notts County in 2009-10. His final club jobs were with Chinese Super League sides Guangzhou R&F, Shanghai SIPG and Shenzhen between 2013 and 2017, while his final managerial position was a 10-game spell as Philippines boss between October 2018 and January 2019.",2024-01-11 09:33:05,"[0.0041941474075987235, 0.004111754915073885, 0.004789654930440537, 0.003084978041578827, 0.004113376801077994, 0.003603756979040195, 0.005028606780261519, 0.00477926304495063, 0.003601171579481266, 0.002127199430753177, 0.002263237682533147, 0.9999034351597733, 0.002425580562287052, 0.004430665451962005]",,Ex-England-boss-Sven-Goran-Eriksson-diagnosed-with-terminal-cancer.wav

Ex-prime minister Magdalena Andersson told Swedish TV that while the security situation was serious, ""it is not as if war is just outside the door."" Children's rights organisation Bris said that its national helpline did not usually receive calls about the possibility of war. But this week, it had seen an increase in worried calls from youngsters who had seen news reports or posts on TikTok talking about it. Gen Micael Byden said Swedes on an individual level had to prepare themselves mentally After more than two centuries of peace, Sweden is a few steps from joining the Nato defensive alliance, waiting for a green light from Turkey's parliament and then from Hungary. ""If there is one thing that keeps me awake at night, it is the feeling that things are moving too slowly,""  Mr Bohlin told the Society and Defence conference on Sunday . Civil Defence Minister Carl-Oskar Bohlin told his audience there could be war in Sweden Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky called on Sweden during the conference to work with his country and others to manufacture weapons and ""get stronger together"". Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson added that in 2024, Sweden would meet Nato's target of spending 2% of economic output (GDP) on military defence, doubling its spending since 2020. Defence specialist Oscar Jonsson said the tone of the warnings from defence chiefs was something of a storm in a teacup and that 90% of what had been said arose from frustration that too little was being done to build civil and military defence. Gen Byden's warning to prepare mentally for war comes hard on the heels of a warning a month ago from the head of Poland's National Security Bureau (BBN), Jacek Siewiera, who said that ""to avoid war with Russia, countries on Nato's eastern flank should adopt a three-year time horizon to prepare for confrontation"".

In  an essay for People  published Wednesday, the “Law and Order: SVU” actor recalled attempting “to set a boundary” between herself and her alleged rapist, whom she did not name. After he assaulted her, Hargitay wrote, she went into “freeze mode, a common trauma response when there is no option to escape.” Advertisement “It wasn’t sexual  at all. It was dominance and control,” she wrote.

Willian scored the only goal of the game in the first half at Anfield. Liverpool were without the injured Mohamed Salah and Trent Alexander-Arnold.,"Yet until their introduction this semi-final first leg against Fulham was the oddest of tales. Especially not a Klopp vintage who are Premier League leaders, who began this match unbeaten in 14 games at their cathedral, 12 of these wins, with only Manchester United and Arsenal managing to avoid defeat here. Until their advent, this second outing since the loss of Salah on Africa Cup of Nations duty and a first following  Trent Alexander‑Arnold’s knee problem  had featured two other A-listers, Virgil van Dijk and Ibrahima Konaté, being too feeble, too often, in a rearguard also including a makeshift left-back – Joe Gomez – and Conor Bradley, a 20-year-old yet to play in the Premier League. In the absence of Salah and Alexander-Arnold, Klopp did not need to see his captain culpable for Fulham’s opener, yet it was Van Dijk’s weak header that allowed Willian to dance in and score. A touch, as were Liverpool, whose shakiness will alert their main title rivals, Manchester City. But this trident’s toothlessness was summed up by Liverpool’s best efforts coming from long range from a defender, Gomez, and a midfielder, Ryan Gravenberch.

This defeat does not end the fantasy as his side saw enough holes in their hosts’ defence to encourage them in a clash that pitted the land’s second-highest major domestic cup winners in Liverpool (17) against a west London side yet to win a major honour. That was the 2010 Europa League final when Roy Hodgson’s men took the Atlético Madrid of Sergio Agüero, David de Gea and Diego Forlan into extra time at Hamburg’s Volksparkstadion before Forlan’s second goal – after Simon Davies had equalised on 37 minutes – broke their hearts.

Coffey claimed that AI companies “eviscerate the quality content they feed upon,” and Lynch characterized training data scraped without permission as “stolen goods.” Coffey and Lynch also both said that they believe AI companies are infringing on copyright under current law. Lynch urged lawmakers to clarify that using journalistic content without first brokering licensing agreements is not protected by fair use, a legal doctrine that permits copyright violations under certain conditions. Common Ground Senate hearings can be adversarial, but the mood today was largely congenial. The lawmakers and media industry insiders often applauded each others’ statements. Journalism professor Jeff Jarvis was the hearing’s only discordant voice. He asserted that training on data obtained without payment is, indeed, fair use, and spoke against compulsory licensing, arguing that it would damage the information ecosystem rather than safeguard it. “I must say that I am offended to see publishers lobby for protectionist legislation, trading on the political capital earned through journalism,” he said, jabbing at his fellow speakers. (Jarvis was also subject to the hearing’s only real contentious line of questioning, from Republican Marsha Blackburn, who needled Jarvis about whether AI is biased against conservatives and recited an AI-generated poem praising President Biden as evidence.) OpenAI and other AI companies have argued that it’s not viable to license all training data, and some independent AI experts agree.",2024-01-10 22:55:11,"[0.011666853291231367, 0.1796739318019709, 0.01370863271253677, 0.007571334073864175, 0.014068255164536424, 0.005080000451533376, 0.004616237515858794, 0.9716140729711946, 0.14767082737492757, 0.00827504954682053, 0.0027148891117628384, 0.006759186515624686, 0.02405839307320671, 0.023451208861215697]",,Congress-Wants-Tech-Companies-to-Pay-Up-for-AI-Training-Data.wav

ChatGPT then asked for permission to call up AllTrail’s API and handed over the query to AllTrails, before collating and displaying the suggestion that came back. GPTs are also limited, content-wise, by the policies and guidelines OpenAI has already put in place. Sometime in the first quarter of this year, OpenAI says it will introduce a payment model for app developers and creators—the company calls them “builders”—who make GPTs. This suggests OpenAI’s model will be similar to those of platforms that reward developers and creators for how engaged their audiences are and how effectively they bring people back to their host platform, rather than a model like the 70/30 revenue split for app sales that Apple has used for its mobile App Store since it launched in 2008. The popular and accessible design app, which claims 170 million monthly active users and 17 million paying subscribers, pays out royalties for every premium design used in its service. Canva also seems comfortable with generative AI, and it has partnered with OpenAI and its rival Stable Diffusion over the past year to make AI image-generators available within its own app. Now, Canva has a custom GPT within ChatGPT, putting its product inside the AI platform that it previously tapped to add AI to its own app. Anwar Haneef, general manager and head of ecosystems at Canva, maintains that Canva users often want to make custom designs or iterate on them rather than have an AI engine generate something from whole cloth. Olson, CEO of Consensus, says he understands OpenAI’s plans to charge by usage and engagement, saying it fits with the company’s core business of computing and organizing the information. He would like more clarity on what he calls “the rev-sharing road map,” but for now, “it’s a way to drive value to ChatGPT Plus users  and  it’s a channel to get people into our research product and learn about us.” Sometimes it just makes sense to go where the attention is, and ChatGPT is the center of the tech universe right now.

For young, otherwise healthy people, the risk of getting seriously sick is very low. Stay up-to-date on vaccinations is the best way to protect your community.","Since 2021, all dominant Covid variants have descended from Omicron. That is, if people keep up with their vaccinations—and most haven’t. For young, otherwise healthy people, the risk of getting seriously sick is very low. The problem, Topol says, “is that young, healthy people interact with at-risk people, and they don’t have enough respect for that.” Cameron Wolfe, professor of infectious disease at Duke University, says that staying up-to-date on vaccinations is the best way to protect your community, regardless of personal risk level. “If you’re 75 and have a kidney transplant, or your spouse is going through chemotherapy, that little extra piece of boosted Covid immunity makes all the difference.” The 2023–2024 booster is not as miraculous as the first 2021 vaccines, but it’s still about as good as we generally expect flu shots to be. While it doesn’t perfectly defend against infection (and protection doesn’t seem to extend much beyond  6 months ), a  recent meta-analysis  found promising evidence that the shot may cut the risk of contracting long Covid by about 70 percent. “I think we’ve got a good few weeks left. If you have a big wedding or vacation coming up—anything you don’t want to be sick for—he strongly suggests planning your vaccinations, masking, and testing beforehand. Extra precaution certainly doesn’t hurt (and for high-risk folks, it remains crucial), but so far, JN.1 doesn’t appear to be causing more severe outcomes than previous variants. “We’re in a better place than we were four years ago, on both an individual and a societal level,” says Wolfe. “We’ve sort of forgotten about how socially immobile we had become.” Now, he says, Covid severity has settled down to a level that is, for many people, broadly comparable to RSV and the flu. “It’s just extraordinarily different than what we faced a couple of years ago,” Wolfe says.",2024-01-10 17:15:16,"[0.041875897105070066, 0.3142930674009696, 0.057595420594293685, 0.06284165797800359, 0.04449954915589813, 0.0310583083689657, 0.245946527677155, 0.031672907518227, 0.1442522760409661, 0.04176177463299264, 0.8746426039072674, 0.036521635115856516, 0.173401222635354, 0.09385100562805472]",,Theres-a-Huge-Covid-Surge-Right-Now-and-Nobody-Is-Talking-About-It.wav

When applied to agricultural fields, this sort of carbon is known as biochar. The material also helps retain water in sandy soils, for instance, which tend to drain quickly otherwise.","“If you’re just burying carbohydrates, you always have this risk that you don’t have it in the right conditions,” says Paul Dauenhauer, senior adviser and cofounder of Carba and a chemical engineer at the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities. “And so if 10, 20, or 30 percent of the material that you bury ends up degrading, that’s a loss of a lot of credibility.” You don’t even need an abandoned coal mine to get rid of the processed biomass—Carba is burying it in landfills, too—so the technique could be used pretty much anywhere. “Every municipality has wastepaper waste, tree clippings, and grasses, all that kind of stuff,” says Dauenhauer. “But also, you can imagine packaging centers, where they have all the waste cardboard. That’s all carbohydrate and cellulose also.” When applied to agricultural fields, this sort of carbon is known as biochar, which also improves soils. “That biochar, some of it will degrade, but we’re talking stability of hundreds to thousands of years.” The material also helps retain water in sandy soils, for instance, which tend to drain quickly otherwise. “Biochar is a highly, highly absorbent material,” says Wendy Lu Maxwell-Barton, executive director of the International Biochar Initiative. “This is why biochar is such an extraordinary soil amendment … it makes it more resilient to both drought conditions as well as flooding.” Biochar is also quantifiable, Maxwell-Barton says: With a certain amount of biomass, you create a certain amount of carbon to store in soils or underground. Indeed, biochar accounts for  90 percent of the carbon removal market , in which companies  pay to offset  their greenhouse gas emissions. Alternatively, it’s harder to quantify exactly how much carbon you’re sequestering by restoring a complex forest ecosystem. Not that humans shouldn’t also protect these habitats—such “nature-based solutions”  sequester carbon , bolster species, reduce flooding, and boost tourism industries.

Patients whose eczema flare-ups or itchy skin were normally only a problem in the winter were coming to her clinic at the height of summer.","In June last year, a series of devastating wildfires  tore through  the Canadian province of Quebec, sending huge plumes of acrid smoke  drifting  across North America. Three hundred miles away in Boston, dermatologist Shadi Kourosh noticed something strange. “We had an unusual spike in dermatology visits,” says Kourosh, who is director of community health in the dermatology department at Massachusetts General Hospital and an assistant professor at Harvard Medical School. Patients whose eczema flare-ups or itchy skin were normally only a problem in the winter were coming to her clinic at the height of summer. Like New York, Detroit, and other cities in the northern United States, Boston was experiencing higher than average air pollution as a result of the wildfires, and Kourosh suspected this might be having an impact on people’s skin. To prove it, her team pulled five years of data from the US Environmental Protection Agency about the levels of airborne particulate matter and carbon monoxide in Boston, and matched it to anonymized patient records from the Mass General Brigham hospital system, the largest hospital group in Massachusetts. They  found  a correlation between levels of air pollution and hospital visits for atopic dermatitis, the most common form of eczema. In June 2022, in Boston, carbon monoxide levels were at less than 0.2 parts per million, and the number of clinic visits for atopic dermatitis and eczema was under 20. In June 2023, during the wildfires, carbon monoxide levels were three times higher, at 0.6 parts per million, and the number of dermatology visits had increased to 160. It’s not just acute events like wildfires that can impact the skin—day-to-day pollution from vehicles and industry also has an effect. “A lot of these components of airborne pollution are irritants to the skin,” Kourosh explains. “People who have eczema have a weakened, more vulnerable skin barrier, and so the pollutants penetrate deeper and trigger the immune system,” she says.",2024-01-10 12:00:00,"[0.00826461680006155, 0.013731818657111558, 0.00830584917201309, 0.008659909561666351, 0.006860633738643451, 0.0033158082628815073, 0.836812873241785, 0.004764101988777716, 0.017443882340074587, 0.004790901750231205, 0.5465151830493756, 0.00821281940704198, 0.012230868689044369, 0.006283001281253423]",,Air-Pollution-Is-Ruining-Your-Skin.wav

Shari Redstone is selling National Amusements, which owns 77% of Paramount Global’s voting shares. On Wednesday,  the Wall Street Journal reported  that Skydance, the Hollywood studio that co-produced “Top Gun: Maverick” with Paramount, is in talks for an all-cash bid for National Amusements, with Skydance CEO David Ellison getting backing from his tech tycoon father, Oracle founder Larry Ellison. Those obligations could make National Amusements a tougher sell to private-equity, sources said. Although buyout firms wouldn’t face the same regulatory hurdles to a deal as media rivals, added difficulties in financing the deal would make it more challenging to turn a profit, sources said. And while Paramount is in the process of  trying to sell the BET network  to raise its stock price, proceeds likely couldn’t be used to pay off National Amusement’s debt given Paramount’s own onerous debt load, one of the sources said.

Chatting with ET from the red-carpet premiere of  Masters of the Air , the 27-year-old actor and model said that while he doesn't have many memories from when Spielberg, 77, and Judd, 51, worked first together, there are definitely moments that stick out.

Jane’s Father Smacked Her While appearing on the former “Scandal” actress Kerry Washington’s  “Street You Grew Up On”  podcast, Jane recalled when her father married his second wife Susan Blanchard, a Jewish socialite and stepdaughter of musical theater director and composer Oscar Hammerstein II, after the suicide of her mother. When he married Susan, Henry moved to Greeenwich Village in New York City, across the country from where Jane and her younger brother Peter were raised in Los Angeles. When asked by Kerry if she was exposed to black people in Los Angeles, Jane replied, “No, not at all. He said, ‘Don’t you ever, ever say that word again.’” Jane went on to say that when Henry was a child, his father forced him to watch a Black man be hanged and his body be dragged around the town’s square in Omaha, Nebraska. “That had a huge impact on my father,” she explained, adding that it inspired him to make movies like  The Ox-Bow Incident  (1943),  The Wrong Man  (1956), and  12 Angry Men  (1957).

Andrew Accused Of Visiting Epstein’s Island The Messenger  reported that Maxwell claimed in a 2016 deposition that Andrew visited the Little St. James property owned by Epstein at least once. In the documents, Maxwell was asked by her lawyer, “Did Prince Andrew ever tell you that he had sex with Virginia Roberts?” and “Did Jeffrey Epstein ever tell you that Prince Andrew had sex with Virginia Roberts?” Maxwell, who was convicted in 2021 of five counts related to the crimes she allegedly committed as Epstein’s longtime madam, answered “no” to both questions. “Did Prince Andrew ever visit that island — are you aware of Prince Andrew ever visiting Jeffrey’s island?” Maxwell was then asked, to which she responded: “I am aware of that, yes.” Maxwell went on to testify that while she did not know how many times Andrew visited the island, she was present on at least one occasion that he was there. “There were no girls on the island at all. “Girls meaning — I assume you are asking underage, but there was nobody female outside of the cooks and the cleaners.” Related:  In New Docs, Epstein Accuser Claims Pedophile Had Sex Tapes of Clinton, Prince Andrew, And Richard Branson Andrew’s Alleged Puppet Fetish Exposed This comes after Andrew’s name came up repeatedly earlier this month in unsealed documents that listed over 150 names of Epstein associates. In one of the documents, Epstein accuser Johanna Sjoberg talked about allegedly meeting Epstein years ago with her fellow “victim” Virginia Roberts Giuffre. “At one point, Ghislaine told me to come upstairs, and we went into a closet and pulled out the puppet, the caricature of Prince Andrew, and brought it down,” she claimed, according to  The Messenger . “And there was a little tag on the puppet that said ‘Prince Andrew’ on it, and that’s when I knew who he was.” “It looked like him,” Sjoberg continued. They put the puppet on Virginia’s lap, and I sat on Andrew’s lap, and they put the puppet’s hand on Virginia’s breast, and Andrew put his hand on my breast, and they took a photo.” Full Story:  Prince Andrew’s Alleged Puppet Fetish Exposed In Disturbing Epstein Documents Giuffre’s Claims Against Andrew Newsweek reported  that in a court filing against Andrew, Giuffre’s lawyers claimed, “During each of the aforementioned incidents, [Giuffre] was compelled by express or implied threats by Epstein, Maxwell, and/or Prince Andrew to engage in sexual acts with Prince Andrew, and feared death or physical injury to herself or another and other repercussions for disobeying Epstein, Maxwell, and Prince Andrew due to their powerful connections, wealth, and authority.” At the time of this writing, Andrew has never been charged in connection with Epstein’s crimes, though he did resign from his public roles in May of 2020.

Hunter’s visit was brief, but he had time to hear Mace absolutely unload on him. “My first question is, who bribed Hunter Biden to be here today?” she began. Coming into the Oversight Committee, spitting in our face, ignoring a congressional subpoena to be deposed.

It seems being told you have “no balls” by Mace and then having to endure the wrath of Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) right afterwards proved to be too much for the President’s son. “I think it’s clear and obvious for everyone watching this hearing today that Hunter Biden is terrified of strong conservative Republican women because he can’t even face my words as I was about to speak to him,” Greene said as Hunter scurried away.

Fiduciary Responsibility Putting an emphasis and even rules related to climate change, sustainability, and diversity initiatives as a litmus test for investment many would argue goes against the fiduciary responsibility of investment firms. Unfortunately, for ESG last year, many “green” and “diversity” investments failed to produce positive returns. Elon Musk, who has long been a critic of ESG,  explained  the dangerous game these firms have been playing with client funds – which includes retirements, 401(k)s, and more in BlackRock’s portfolio: To tell customers that you are making investment decisions based on their possible best option for return only to attach arbitrary untested ESG metrics against the investments is what normal people would call lying. Mr. Fink believes it is his responsibility and  right  as the CEO of BlackRock to force behaviors he deems appropriate. “If you don’t achieve these levels of impact, your compensation can be impacted.” Sounds a little like investment blackmail using climate change and diversity as the requirements. Are the latest layoffs a sign that Mr. Fink understands that he has not been acting in his customers’ best interests, or is it just an attempt to put out the current political and litigation fires around his firm?

""It can serve as a surgical training platform for clinicians, medical students, and trainees, allow device engineers to study their new designs, and even help patients better understand their own disease and potential treatments."" Before new interventions reach humans, they undergo rigorous testing in heart simulators and animal subjects. However, current heart simulators don't completely capture the complexity of a heart and have a short shelf-life of two to four hours. This condition, affecting about 24.2 million people worldwide, can cause shortness of breath, swelling in the limbs, and heart failure. To better understand the mitral valve in healthy and diseased states, the team built a biorobotic heart based on a pig heart. All three procedures were successful, bringing the pressure, flow, and heart function to normal. ""It was really interesting for the surgeons to see every step,"" says Roche. She foresees their heart model as a realistic environment for cardiac surgery training and practice. Instead of using a pig heart, they're also exploring 3D printing technology to recreate a synthetic human heart for the system.

As average winter temperatures in a watershed increase beyond 17 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 8 degrees Celsius), snow loss accelerates. Many highly populated watersheds that rely on snow for water supply are going to see accelerating losses over the next few decades.","Similarly, scientific data from ground observations, satellites, and climate models do not agree on whether global warming is consistently chipping away at the snowpacks that accumulate in high-elevation mountains, complicating efforts to manage the water scarcity that would result for many population centers. ""We were most concerned with how warming is affecting the amount of water stored in snow. We're on that path and not particularly well adapted when it comes to water scarcity."" But these heavy losses threaten economies in states such as Vermont, New York, and New Hampshire that depend on winter recreation, Mankin said -- even machine-made snow has a temperature threshold many areas are fast approaching. ""Ski resorts at lower elevations and latitudes have already been contending with year-on-year snow loss. ""We'll likely see further consolidation of skiing into large, well-resourced resorts at the expense of small and medium-sized ski areas that have such crucial local economic and cultural values. This not only let them identify where snowpack losses occurred due to warming, it also gave them the ability to examine the counteracting influence of climate-driven changes in temperature and precipitation, which decrease and increase snowpack thickness, respectively. Snow comes with uncertainties that have masked the effects of global warming, Mankin said. ""Snow observations are tricky at the regional scales most relevant for assessing water security,"" Mankin said. This means that as average winter temperatures in a watershed increase beyond 17 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 8 degrees Celsius), snow loss accelerates even with only modest increases in local average temperatures. Many highly populated watersheds that rely on snow for water supply are going to see accelerating losses over the next few decades, Mankin said.

""The IVPP has been excavating for  G. blacki  evidence in this region for over 10 years but without solid dating and a consistent environmental analysis, the cause of its extinction had eluded us."" Definitive evidence revealing the story of the giant ape's extinction has come from a large-scale project collecting evidence from 22 cave sites spread across a wide region of Guangxi Province in southern China. ""Without robust dating, you are simply looking for clues in the wrong places."" Southern Cross also mapped  G. blacki  teeth to extract information on the apes' behaviours. Six different dating techniques were applied to the cave sediments and fossils, producing 157 radiometric ages.

They cascade down into our atmosphere along magnetic field lines near Earth's poles, colliding with gas molecules and creating eerie, dancing curtains of light. Jupiter and Saturn have similar auroral processes that involve interacting with the solar wind, but they also get auroral contributions from nearby active moons like Io (for Jupiter) and Enceladus (for Saturn). A team led by Jackie Faherty, an astronomer at the American Museum of Natural History in New York, was awarded time with the Webb telescope to investigate 12 cold brown dwarfs. Among those were W1935 -- an object that was discovered by citizen scientist Dan Caselden, who worked with the Backyard Worlds zooniverse project -- and W2220, an object that was discovered using NASA's Wide Field Infrared Survey Explorer. This was seen at a distinct infrared wavelength to which Webb is uniquely sensitive. ""We have seen this kind of phenomenon in planets with a nearby star that can heat the stratosphere, but seeing it in an object with no obvious external heat source is wild."" The team realized that temperature inversions are prominent in planets like Jupiter and Saturn. Astronomers have detected radio emission coming from several warmer brown dwarfs and invoked aurorae as the most likely explanation. Searches were conducted with ground-based telescopes like the Keck Observatory for infrared signatures from these radio-emitting brown dwarfs to further characterize the phenomenon, but were inconclusive. In our solar system the solar wind is a primary contributor to auroral processes, with active moons like Io and Enceladus playing a role for planets like Jupiter and Saturn, respectively.

But if a rocket could burn its own parts as fuel, it could free up capacity for transporting more important science projects and supplies. The concept of a rocket that eats its own parts was first patented in 1938, but a working prototype was never built because it would have been tough to execute with the  enormous rockets  that have historically performed most launches. In recent years, however, small satellites have risen in popularity, so there is increasing demand for smaller, more efficient rockets that are not limited by the need to carry their own enormous heft into space. Advertisement Krzysztof Bzdyk  at the University of Glasgow in the UK and his colleagues have built a small prototype of a rocket engine that eats its own fuel tank. It isn’t powerful enough to loft anything into space but still demonstrates that the concept works. “Because we’re burning the fuselage, we’re getting rid of the problem of miniaturising the rocket, so when you want to send a small payload to space you can do it right away rather than waiting for a rideshare mission on a larger rocket,” he says.

That tube constitutes up to one-fifth of the total propellant used for the burn, which provides about 100 newtons of thrust – only about four times as much force as it takes to break an egg. The team is now working on a larger-scale prototype that could provide about 1000 newtons of thrust, which is about one-sixth as much as the engine will need to make it to  suborbital space  and about one-twentieth as much as it will need to make it to orbit. “With added tests, they should be able to scale up the rocket… [but] sometimes scaling up is not trivial, easy or likely,” says  Haym Benaroya  at Rutgers University in New Jersey.",2024-01-10 00:01:53,"[0.005151471318151601, 0.00919303262117667, 0.007822182330017325, 0.0026628715902702023, 0.0037447813143222405, 0.0032847912533493506, 0.030829697137074244, 0.0025023414950981785, 0.0054833148693240645, 0.0034271176059865226, 0.9993386159453597, 0.003752112862617906, 0.009788206320941387, 0.0031239979574717047]",,Prototype-rocket-engine-burns-itself-up-for-fuel-as-it-flies.wav

NASA has delayed its  Artemis II  flight, which was originally intended to bring four astronauts around the moon in late 2024, until September 2025. Its Artemis III mission to land  astronauts on the lunar surface  for the first time since 1972 has also been moved – from 2025 to 2026 at the earliest. During a press briefing on 9 January, NASA officials said this decision was made to ensure crew safety and allow time for sufficient testing of all the components of the spacecraft. Advertisement “I want to emphasise that safety is our number one priority… And as we prepare to send our friends and colleagues on this mission, we’re committed to launching as safely as possible,” said NASA associate administrator  Jim Free  during the briefing. “We will launch, when we’re ready.” One cause for concern was that in tests, the heat shield on  the Orion spacecraft  – the crew capsule for the Artemis missions – burned up a little more than expected, with some charred bits falling off. “Now, this heat shield is an ablative material – it is supposed to char – but it’s not what we were expecting, with some pieces of that char to be liberated from the vehicle,” NASA official  Amit Kshatriya  said during the briefing. NASA is in the midst of investigating why that happened, as well as analysing some other problems that occurred during testing, including faults appearing in valves that could potentially affect the life-support systems on the spacecraft. “We know how to fix it,” said Kshatriya. “We just need to make sure we take the time to do it according to the workmanship standard that we expect for a human-rated vehicle.” Voyage across the galaxy and beyond with our space newsletter every month.

A leading explanation is that the FRBs are generated by powerful rotating stars known as magnetars – highly magnetised, spinning cores left behind after massive stars explode as supernovae.","To date, astronomers have discovered more than 1000 FRBs, strange blasts of radio-frequency electromagnetic radiation that streak across the sky in just milliseconds. Some of the events repeat and have been detected flashing multiple times. A leading explanation is that the FRBs are generated by powerful rotating stars known as magnetars – highly magnetised, spinning cores left behind after massive stars explode as supernovae. Advertisement About 50 FRBs have been pinpointed to sources in the Milky Way and other galaxies. Alexa Gordon  at Northwestern University in Illinois led a team that followed up on the discovery. Using the Hubble Space Telescope in April 2023, the researchers found that FRB 20220610A originated in a small dwarf galaxy that was part of a compact group of seven galaxies so small that the entire collection would fit inside our Milky Way. This supports the magnetar explanation for FRBs, as magnetars probably form early in a galaxy’s evolution when hot and massive stars explode. In compact groups, “the galaxies are interacting pretty frequently”, Gordon says. This triggers star formation that matches what we see in studies of FRBs generated by sources that are younger and closer to Earth. “The majority are in star-forming spiral galaxies,” says Gordon. “But we’ve also discovered FRBs in galaxy clusters, dwarf galaxies and a globular cluster. Adding ‘compact group’ to this list is another example of how we’re finding FRBs in diverse places.” Reference: arXiv  DOI: 10.48550/arXiv.2311.10815 Topics: galaxies",2024-01-09 20:15:48,"[0.005238598042916991, 0.008948239542908687, 0.0058904197535861345, 0.0027499419991908443, 0.0034718196213283773, 0.0033096725127736296, 0.02188941800116549, 0.002552351238678187, 0.005320901130067222, 0.0037002295857331384, 0.9996090970457505, 0.0035620393703173856, 0.007566872088207547, 0.0033558949232852667]",,Mysterious-radio-burst-came-from-group-of-galaxies-in-distant-universe.wav
