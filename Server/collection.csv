But that’s kind of what it’s been and I think, quite frankly, Fox News has bailed him out for allowing him not to debate.” The comments arrive a day after a man in Iowa confronted DeSantis on why he hasn’t “ gone directly ” after Trump on the campaign trail.

But they held one-sixth of so-called unrealized capital gains in the country. Under current law, growth in the value of assets like stocks, bonds, investments, real estate or businesses is not taxable.","Americans worth more than $100 million sat on a whopping $8.5 trillion in untaxed profits in 2022, a report released Wednesday found  — money that may never be taxed unless Congress closes a loophole shielding the investments of the ultrarich. These centimillionaires and billionaires made up just 0.05% of all American households in 2022, according to Federal Reserve data  analyzed  by the progressive nonprofit Americans for Tax Fairness. But they held one-sixth of so-called unrealized capital gains in the country. Advertisement Unrealized gains are the primary source of income for many elite families. Under current law, growth in the value of assets like stocks, bonds, investments, real estate or businesses is not taxable until they are “realized,” or sold. The ultrawealthy can nonetheless live off these gains by taking out low-interest loans against their exorbitant wealth. And when their fortunes become inheritances, the gains are no longer taxable. “The superrich truly live in a strange and privileged world,” said David Kass, the executive director of Americans for Tax Fairness. While most households depend on paychecks — “income that is taxed all year, every year,” Kass noted — these untaxed gains make up the largest single source of income for the ultrawealthy. “The scandal of tax-free billionaires,” Kass added, also results in billions of dollars less in tax revenue that could fund health care, housing, education and other public programs. Led by President Joe Biden, Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) and Reps. Steve Cohen (D-Tenn.) and Don Beyer (D-Va.) have introduced a  “Billionaires Income Tax”  in both chambers of Congress. The tax would apply only to unrealized gains held by ultrawealthy households, and could generate an estimated $500 billion in new revenue over a decade. Advertisement Biden has also proposed ending the loophole, known as the stepped-up basis, that erases capital gains for tax purposes when wealthy individuals pass on their fortunes as inheritance. Since 1989, when the Federal Reserve began collecting this data, households worth more than $100 million have nearly tripled their share of the country’s unrealized gains.

Among the famous people in Epstein’s orbit before he was exposed as a sexual predator were former Presidents Donald Trump and Bill Clinton. Michael Jackson and magician David Copperfield were also mentioned in the documents.,"It was during Maxwell’s criminal trial two years ago that Epstein’s victims, some of whom aspired to be models or artists, described how he dropped the names of his famous and influential friends to suggest that he was the victims’ ticket to reaching their dreams. Maxwell, 62, was convicted of sex trafficking charges and is serving  a 20-year prison sentence . The roughly 250 documents being unsealed, starting this week, in one of the lawsuits against Maxwell mostly rehash what has long been known about a man who traveled in elite circles until his July 2019 sex-trafficking arrest left him so cornered that he took his own life in jail. But they have included a few fresh details about a pyramid of abuse that grew over three decades and damaged dozens of teenage girls and young women. Advertisement Among the famous people in Epstein’s orbit before he was exposed as a sexual predator were former Presidents  Donald Trump  and Bill Clinton, singer Michael Jackson and magician David Copperfield, according to the accounts of his victims and other witnesses quoted in newly released documents. There were also repetitions of well-known stories about Britain’s Prince Andrew. The court documents being released now are related to a 2015 lawsuit that Giuffre brought against Maxwell. U.S. District Judge Loretta A. Preska ordered last month that those redactions be lifted, mostly because names in the documents had already been made public through news coverage or through other court proceedings. Sjoberg said she once met Michael Jackson at Epstein’s Palm Beach, Florida, home, but that nothing untoward happened with the late pop icon. Epstein also had homes in Manhattan, New Mexico and the Virgin Islands. Advertisement She also described an April 2001 trip to New York in which she said Prince Andrew touched her breast while they posed for a photo at Epstein’s Manhattan town house. She said Copperfield did magic tricks before asking if she was aware “that girls were getting paid to find other girls.” One allegation against Epstein and Maxwell was that some girls he paid for sexual acts later recruited other victims. Sjoberg said Copperfield didn’t get more specific about what he meant. The newly released records also include many references to Jean-Luc Brunel, a French modeling agent who was close to Epstein and who  killed himself in a Paris jail  in 2022 while awaiting trial on charges that he raped underage girls. Advertisement Separately, Brunel’s estate  was sued this week  by a woman who alleges that he and others sexually assaulted her while she was working as a model in New York.

He shot her multiple times through a bathroom door in 2013, later saying he mistook her for a burglar. He will live under strict conditions until his sentence expires in 2029.","9 minutes ago About sharing Oscar Pistorius's various trials and hearings attracted enormous media interest By Daniel De Simone in Johannesburg & Damian Zane in London BBC News Ex-Paralympian Oscar Pistorius is to be freed on parole from a South African jail, nearly 11 years after murdering his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp. He shot her multiple times through a bathroom door in 2013, later saying he mistook her for a burglar. Pistorius, now 37, was eventually convicted of murder in 2015 after an appeal court overturned an earlier verdict of culpable homicide. He will live under strict conditions until his sentence expires in 2029. Under South African law, all offenders are entitled to be considered for parole once they have served half their total sentence, which for Pistorius was finally set in 2017 at 13 years and five months. He has been in prison since October 2014, when he was first convicted. His lower legs were amputated when he was less than a year old. Pistorius subsequently relied on prosthetics and became a world-renowned athlete known as the ""blade runner"". He had a successful career on the track, first at the Paralympics, winning multiple golds, and then cementing his reputation after competing against non-disabled athletes at the London Olympics in 2012. South Africa's department of correctional services said that despite his high public profile, the former star will be treated like anyone else on parole. This means that he will be confined to his home for certain hours of the day and he is banned from drinking alcohol. Friends say Reeva Steenkamp was kind-hearted and ambitious Ms Steenkamp, who was 29 when she died, was a law graduate and successful model who also worked as a TV presenter and appeared in a reality show called Tropika Island of Treasure. She had planned to start a law firm to help abused women after graduating. Ms Steenkamp was three months into her relationship with Pistorius when he fired four shots with a pistol through the door of a toilet cubicle at his house in Pretoria in the early hours of 14 February 2013. The state charged Pistorius with murder but he was convicted in 2014 of the lesser offence of culpable homicide, or manslaughter. The following year, judges at the Supreme Court of Appeal changed his conviction to murder, saying that his version of events was inconsistent and improbable and that he had ""fired without having a rational or genuine fear that his life was in danger"". In a letter read out to the parole board in November, Ms Steenkamp's mother, June Steenkamp, said she did not oppose his release but wondered whether Pistorius's ""huge anger issues"" had been truly dealt with in prison. She added that she would be ""concerned for the safety of any woman"" who now comes into contact with him. Mrs Steenkamp said that while she did not believe her daughter's killer had shown remorse, she had nonetheless decided to forgive him ""long ago, as I knew most certainly that I would not be able to survive if I had to cling to my anger"".

A BBC investigation found 20 online pharmacies selling restricted drugs without checks - such as GP approval. In total, we bought over 1,600 various prescription-only pills by entering false information without challenge. Regulator the General Pharmaceutical Council says extra checks are needed when selling some drugs online. ""The current guidance basically tells pharmacies to be robust, but do that in your own way, and we know that under this current system, patients have died,"" she says. The parents of a woman who died in 2020, after accidentally overdosing on medicines she bought online, are among those calling for stricter rules. Katie Corrigan, from St Erth in Cornwall, had developed an addiction to painkillers after experiencing neck pain. ""Katie needed help, she didn't need more medication,"" says her mum, Christine Taylor. In his final report, he said the safety controls were inadequate. It also states that ""high-risk, habit-forming medicines"", like those Katie Corrigan was able to buy, should not be sold online without additional safeguards. We are not naming these drugs because they can be dangerous when taken without medical guidance. Of the 20 businesses we identified selling one or more restricted drugs: We found nine pharmacies selling the anti-anxiety drug Three pharmacies sold the anti-anxiety medicine to us on the basis of our answers to an online questionnaire and did not require further checks In total, we were able to buy a potentially fatal dose of the anti-anxiety medicine  We bought the painkiller from nine pharmacies based on online questionnaires  We similarly obtained the sleeping medication from 14 pharmacies But 13 online pharmacies which sold at least one of these drugs refused to sell to us without access to some medical records, proof that we had been prescribed them before by a doctor, or permission to contact our GP to carry out further safety checks. One online pharmacy sent a marketing email telling us we had ""something fabulous"" in our basket and to ""buy before time runs out"", referring to an addictive painkiller. This is language the regulator, which can disqualify a pharmacist from its register, says should not be used. Five of the pharmacies that sold to us sent follow-up emails with more safety information and contact details if we had concerns or needed to ask any questions. One woman, who wanted to remain anonymous, said she bought a prescription-only weight loss drug in July by falsely claiming to be roughly double her real weight in a questionnaire. But Ms Gorrund says the guidance from the regulator is too vague, and does not state clearly enough what checks online pharmacies should be conducting. The GPhC issued renewed guidance in 2022 after it found hundreds of its investigations into whether pharmacies should be allowed to continue operating related specifically to online pharmacies. A spokesperson said: ""We have made it clear that medicines liable to abuse, overuse or misuse, such as opioids and sedatives, should not be sold online unless further safeguards have been put in place. ""We have taken regulatory action against online pharmacies which fell short of professional standards, including in some cases where 'high-risk, habit-forming' medicines were supplied on the basis of an online questionnaire.""",2024-01-05 09:55:05,"[0.13459913848945634, 0.10191752584217134, 0.08128189025925737, 0.05213582912234505, 0.9809031549963096]",,Prescription-drugs-sold-online-without-proper-checks-BBC-finds.wav

But he warned of ""dangers"" in ""very easy access to mortgage credit"" Comments come as mortgage interest rates have started to fall, but overall remain higher than in recent years.","17 minutes ago About sharing Sir Howard Davies is the chair of the NatWest group By Michael Race Business reporter, BBC News NatWest's chair has said he believes it is not currently ""that difficult"" for people to get on the housing ladder. Sir Howard Davies said people have always had to save for a deposit but admitted you had to save more today. He told the BBC he recognised people were ""finding it difficult to start the process"", but warned of ""dangers"" in ""very easy access to mortgage credit"". His comments come as mortgage interest rates have started to fall, but overall remain higher than in recent years. With the gap between house prices and average earnings widening over decades, saving enough money to put down initially is the biggest hurdle for many hoping to buy a home. It is also one factor in why the average age of a first-time buyer has risen to 32. Asked when he thought it would be easier for people to get on to the property ladder in the UK, Sir Howard said: ""Well, I don't think it's that difficult at the moment. ""What we saw in the financial crisis was the risk of having people being able to borrow 100% and then suffering severe falls in the equity value of their houses and having to leave and having a bad credit record so there were dangers in very, very easy access to mortgage credit,"" Sir Howard added. While people have to save more cash for a deposit, the rising cost of living has hindered many people's ability to set money aside with energy bills and food costs soaring in recent years. Inflation - the rate prices rise at - hit a 40-year high in 2022 and as a result, the Bank of England has increased interest rates to try to slow it down, making the cost of borrowing money more expensive. Renters hoping to save for their own home have also seen their monthly outgoings rise sharply, with a new let costing  £1,201 a month on average, according to Zoopla . High demand has driven the increase, while supply has also narrowed with some private landlords selling up as a result of higher mortgage rates. Torsten Bell, boss of the Resolution Foundation think tank which focuses on improving living standards for those on low to middle incomes, said prior to Sir Howard's comments that the most common living arrangement for an adult aged between 18 and 34 in 1997 was ""being in a couple with children"". ""Today the most common is... living with your parents,""  he posted on X , formerly known as Twitter. On Friday, the average two-year fixed rate was 5.83%, while a five-year deal was 5.43%, according to financial information service Moneyfacts. There are signs pressure on mortgage-holders is easing, with several big lenders announcing cuts in recent days, though many homeowners coming off fixed-rate deals will still face big repayment increases. Kim Kinnaird, director at Halifax Mortgages, said with mortgage rates easing, buyers' confidence could increase in the coming months. Halifax said house prices rose for the third month in a row to average £287,105 in December, but it forecast a fall this year with buyers perhaps becoming more cautious due to economic uncertainty. While Halifax is the UK's biggest mortgage lender, its figures only take into account buyers with mortgages - about two-thirds of all sales - and do not include those who purchase homes with cash or buy-to-let deals. Separate figures from the Bank of England published on Thursday showed the number of mortgage approvals rose slightly in November, which could be seen as a sign of a touch more confidence from buyers late last year.",2024-01-05 10:49:25,"[0.9900822868373317, 0.05992375188544524, 0.09370921958414612, 0.05788486674103562, 0.06335719073818026]",,Sir-Howard-Davies-Not-that-difficult-to-buy-a-home-says-NatWest-chair.wav

Inspired by London's underground music scene, they'd just started writing together when the pandemic forced them apart. The pause gave them time to develop their sound, drawing on 70s art-rock albums by Sparks and Roxy Music, while channelling the fiery femininity of Siouxsie Sioux and Florence Welch. Their first gig took place at London's George Tavern in November 2021, where they drew an audience of just 20 people. The Last Dinner Party (L-R): and Lizzie Mayland (guitar), Aurora Nishevci (keyboards), Abigail Morris (vocals), Emily Roberts (guitar) and Georgia Davies (bass) But it was their third gig at Venue MOT, a stone's throw from Milwall FC's stadium, that really put them on the map. That ""guy"" was Lou Smith, a film-maker who documents London's underground music scene. When he posted  The Last Dinner Party's set to YouTube , their inboxes suddenly blew up with messages from record labels, managers and PRs. The BBC Sound Of 2024 was voted for by a panel of more 140 industry experts and artists, including Olivia Rodrigo, Jorja Smith, PinkPantheress, Chase & Status, Tom Grennan Mahalia and more. The Top Five acts were: Indie rock band  The Last Dinner Party 'Imperfect' pop star  Olivia Dean Superstar DJ  Peggy Gou South African phenomenon  Tyla Soul sensation  Elmiene The band recently supported Hozier on his European tour Florence Welch is another big fan. ""I think the nuances of femininity almost always get lost in rock,"" she tells the BBC, ""but when I saw The Last Dinner Party playing in their dresses and their chiffon, while being so fierce and ferocious, I was like, 'This is it!'"" ""Don't drink your way through it,"" is her main takeaway. Her bandmates pull her close for a hug, an instinctive act of camaraderie that indicates they'll be strong enough to survive the stormy waters of the music business. As if a focus group would ever create an all-female rock band who look like Adam Ant at a Pride march, singing gothic ballads about repressed Catholic guilt. Fans have connected with the band's unique dress sense That song was  Nothing Matters,  a scorching declaration of lust that burst onto the radio last April. ""There's a whole bootleg black market in our songs,"" says Georgia. ""People download the audio from live videos and put it on their Spotify or SoundCloud. Their goal is to put colour back into an indie scene that had become very self-serious. Fans have latched onto their look, turning up to concerts in willowy ball gowns and elaborate headgear. Unbeknownst to Abigail, her bandmate Lizzie had faced similar struggles growing up in the small Yorkshire town of Hebden Bridge. In just two short years, they've gone from an audience of 20 to support slots with Lana Del Rey and Hozier.",2024-01-05 00:00:25,"[0.04621084744482055, 0.9937542705387342, 0.04934054600458928, 0.06422832231622855, 0.061296333470048196]",,The-Last-Dinner-Party-win-BBC-Radio-1s-Sound-Of-2024.wav

Egypt would also have an unspecified role to play under the plan. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken is due back in the region this week. He is expected to hold talks with Palestinian officials in the occupied West Bank.,"53 minutes ago About sharing A woman mourns the death of her husband in Kahn Younis, Gaza, on Thursday Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant has outlined proposals for the future governance of Gaza once the war between Israel and Hamas is over. There would, he said, be limited Palestinian rule in the territory. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken is due back in the region this week. He is expected to hold talks with Palestinian officials in the occupied West Bank and Israeli leaders. His visit comes amid heightened tensions in the region following the assassination of top Hamas leader Saleh al-Arouri on Tuesday in Lebanon's capital Beirut. Under Mr Galant's now ""four corner"" plan, Israel would retain overall security control of Gaza. Neighbouring Egypt would also have an unspecified role to play under the plan. ""Gaza residents are Palestinian, therefore Palestinian bodies will be in charge, with the condition that there will be no hostile actions or threats against the State of Israel,"" Mr Gallant said. Some far right-wing members of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government have said that Palestinian citizens should be encouraged to leave Gaza for exile, with the reestablishment of Jewish settlements in the territory - controversial proposals that have been rejected as ""extremist"" and ""unworkable"" by other countries in the region and by some of Israel's allies. While Mr Galant's proposals may be regarded as more practical than those suggested by some of his cabinet colleagues, they are likely to be rejected by Palestinian leaders who say that Gazans themselves must be allowed to take full control of running the territory once this devastating war is over. Mr Netanyahu has not publicly talked in any detail about how he thinks Gaza should be governed. He has suggested that the war in Gaza may yet last several months, with the avowed goal being to completely crush Hamas. In the south, the Israeli military would continue to try to track down Hamas leaders and rescue Israeli hostages, he said. Khan Younis, the largest city in the south of the Gaza Strip, was hit by Israeli air strikes on Thursday It said it had conducted strikes on ""terrorist infrastructure"" and had killed people who it described as militants, who it said had tried to detonate an explosive next to soldiers. A health ministry official said 14 people - including nine children - were killed by Israeli air strikes in al-Mawasi, to the west of Khan Younis. The small town has been designated a ""safe space"" by Israeli forces for displaced Palestinians. ""We were sleeping at midnight when a strike hit the camp on the tents, 4x2 tents where people were sleeping, most of them children,"" eyewitness Jamal Hamad Salah told Reuters news agency. ""We found one body there that flew 40 metres away."" ""Camps, shelters, schools, hospitals, homes and so-called 'safe zones' should not be battlegrounds.""

National Security Council spokesman John Kirby called it a ""significant and concerning escalation"" relating to Pyongyang's support for Russia. He said the US would raise the matter at the UN Security Council and impose additional sanctions on those working to facilitate arms transfers. Moscow has denied any such collaboration. However, in September North Korean leader Kim Jong Un visited Russia to discuss potential military cooperation. The US has previously accused Pyongyang of supplying Russia with weapons, but this is the first time US intelligence has shared details about ballistic missiles - self-guided rockets that can reach targets 900km (500 miles) away. Speaking during a White House press briefing on Thursday, Mr Kirby said Russia's procurement of ballistic missiles from North Korea was a direct violation of numerous UN Security Council resolutions. ""We will demand that Russia be held accountable for yet again violating its international obligations,"" he said. He also said the US believed Russia was planning on purchasing close-range missiles from Iran, but that it had not done so yet. The UK said it ""strongly condemns"" Russia's use of ballistic missiles sourced from North Korea in Ukraine. ""North Korea is subject to a robust sanctions regime, and we will continue to work with our partners to ensure that North Korea pays a high price for supporting Russia's illegal war in Ukraine,"" a spokesperson for the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office said. In his briefing, Mr Kirby also urged US Congress to approve extra US funding for Ukraine ""without delay"". ""The most effective response to Russia's horrific violence against the Ukrainian people is to continue to provide Ukraine with vital air defence capabilities and other types of military equipment,"" he said. ""Iran and the DPRK [North Korea] are standing with Russia. Ukrainians deserve to know that the American people and this government will continue to stand with them."" The last US military aid package to Ukraine, worth some $250m (£195m), was approved by Congress on 27 December. Talks on further funding have stalled in Congress because of a lack of support among Republicans, who insist that tougher security measures on the US-Mexico border must be part of any military aid deal. Ukraine has warned that its war effort and the country's public finances are at risk if further Western aid does not come soon.

The documents were part of a case against Ghislaine Maxwell, Epstein's imprisoned former girlfriend. The court records unsealed on Wednesday and Thursday both contain references to the UK's Prince Andrew and former US President Bill Clinton. New York Judge Loretta Preska ruled last month there was no longer any legal justification to withhold the names of more than 150 people mentioned in a 2015 defamation lawsuit filed by Virginia Giuffre, an Epstein accuser, against Maxwell, a former British socialite. Many names in the documents have already been publicly disclosed, or are mentioned in passing as part of various legal proceedings, and their inclusion does not necessarily suggest wrongdoing related to Epstein. Among the previously detailed claims against Prince Andrew is that he sexually abused a minor in London, New York and on Epstein's island in the Virgin Islands, after the teenager was told to do it by Maxwell. The Duke of York has already denied these allegations. The new documents also include a suggestion from a lawyer for Virginia Giuffre that former President Clinton ""may have information"" on Maxwell and Epstein's activities because he had travelled with them. Bill Clinton meets Jeffrey Epstein in 1993 Mr Clinton has acknowledged being a former associate of Epstein and taking flights on the financier's private jet, but has denied wrongdoing or knowledge of his crimes. In another file - a 2011 email exchange between Ms Giuffre and a former Mail on Sunday journalist Sharon Churcher - Ms Giuffre claims Mr Clinton ""walked into VF [Vanity Fair magazine] and threatened them not to write sex-trafficking articles about his good friend J.E [Jeffrey Epstein]"". The BBC has contacted Conde Nast, Vanity Fair's parent company, for comment. In a 2019 BBC interview, Prince Andrew said he could not recall any incident involving Virginia Giuffre One email shows Ms Giuffre emailing a literary agent to pitch a book she is writing titled The Billionaire's Playboy Club. She describes the memoir as ""a Woman's story of glitz, glamor, sorrow, compassion, and true love"". The Mail on Sunday journalist advises Ms Giuffre to say she has no more to disclose at that time about how she was allegedly sex-trafficked to ""two of the world's most respected politicians"". In another court filing released on Wednesday an accuser identified as Jane Doe #3 alleges she was trafficked by Epstein ""for sexual purposes to many other powerful men, including numerous prominent American politicians, powerful business executives, foreign presidents, a well-known Prime Minister, and other world leaders"". In a 2016 deposition, Joseph Recarey, a police detective in Palm Beach, Florida, says that approximately 30 women had spoken to him about ""performing massage and work at Epstein's home"" in the beachfront community. An aerial view of Jeffrey Epstein's island Little St James He added: ""When they went to perform a massage, it was for [Epstein's] sexual gratification."" The new trove includes filings from Maxwell's lawyers in which they argue that the journalist, Ms Churcher, had helped ""concoct"" allegations against Prince Andrew as well as prominent US attorney Alan Dershowitz. Epstein pleaded guilty to soliciting prostitution from a minor in 2009 and took his own life in 2019 while awaiting trial over sex-trafficking charges.

South Korea immediately issued an evacuation warning to civilians on the island, but is yet to confirm if it's connected to the shelling. The South has condemned the move, calling it a ""provocative act"". In 2010, North Korean artillery fired scores of times on Yeonpyeong island, killing four people. The artillery shells fired on Friday, between 09:00 to 11:00 local time (00:00 to 02:00 GMT) did not enter South Korean territory as they all landed in the buffer zone between the two countries. South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff said the incident caused ""no damage to our people or military"", but added that the act ""threatens peace on the Korean peninsula and raises tensions"". The shelling follows warnings from Pyongyang that it was building up its military arsenal in preparation for war that could ""break out at any time"" on the peninsular. Authorities on nearby Baengnyeong Island also reported an evacuation order there. The latest incident comes months after North Korea fully suspended a military deal with the South that had been aimed at improving relations. Afterwards, Pyongyang said it would withdraw all measures ""taken to prevent military conflict in all spheres including ground, sea and air"", and deploy ""more powerful armed forces and new-type military hardware"" in the border region. But North Korea had violated the pact multiple times in the two years before, launching missiles and firing artillery rounds into the sea in the South's direction. The last time North Korea fired artillery shells into the sea was in December 2022, with nine such incidents happening in that year alone. Yeonpyeong island, home to a military base and a small civilian population of about 2,000 people, lies 3km (2 miles) from the disputed maritime border in the Yellow Sea and 12km from the North Korean coast. It has been the scene of inter-Korean naval clashes over the years. In 2010 - two soldiers and two civilians were killed after North Korea fired dozens of artillery shells towards the island.

The NLRB officials allege in a complaint filed Wednesday that SpaceX interrogated workers about the letter and pressured them not to distribute it, according to board spokesperson Kayla Blado. The letter had directly criticized Musk’s behavior on social media. Advertisement The complaint also claims the company “invited employees to quit” and threatened them with termination for exercising their rights, Blado said. SpaceX, which is based in Hawthorne, California, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. It is against the law for employers to retaliate against workers for exercising “protected concerted activity,” or banding together with other workers in hopes of improving their working conditions. The workers who were allegedly retaliated against had criticized Musk's behavior on Twitter, now known as X. via Associated Press The charges submitted to the labor board alleged that after firing five workers, SpaceX continued a “campaign of retaliation and intimidation,” including “coercive interrogations” that led to another three terminations. They also said that during interviews, management showed workers screenshots from private Signal chat groups, making them believe they were being watched. One of the fired workers  told  The New York Times in November that “it was hard for me to believe what was happening, it was so brazen.”  Musk, the CEO of electric-vehicle manufacturer Tesla, created SpaceX in 2002 with the aspiration of one day sending people to Mars. He purchased X, then known as Twitter, in 2022 for $44 billion. Advertisement X has suffered from an exodus of advertisers no longer willing to promote their products on the platform under Musk’s management.

Apple has been embroiled in an intellectual property dispute with the medical technology company Masimo over those technologies.

The two watch models will be available at Apple’s online store by noon Pacific Time on Thursday, according to the company. They will return to some Apple stores Wednesday, with wider availability expected by Saturday. That dispute hasn’t directly affected Apple Watch sales yet because another regulatory body had ruled that AliveCor’s technology isn’t patentable. The legal tussle on that issue is still ongoing.

Swifties  were stunned when those words seemed to perfectly match the man she’s dating today. “I think it’s more a question of confidence,” Swift, 19 at the time,  told Glamour . “I wouldn’t want to be with a pushover who would let me make all the plans and have all the control,” she continued. “It’s really natural for me to go into planning mode, but I’d rather be with someone who has his own voice and passion and ambition.” Advertisement Kelce, a tight end for the  Kansas City Chiefs , is arguably the farthest thing from a pushover, since his job involves regularly blocking tackles for his quarterback. Swift also said in the Glamour interview that it can put strain on a romantic relationship when one person is a professional entertainer and the other isn’t. After “interviews all day” and being “on stage every night,” Swift told the magazine, she “can only give someone what’s left.” “It’s always going to be long-distance, even if I date the boy who lives next door to me in Nashville,” she added. It feels like it would involve more scheduling, and I already deal with a lot of scheduling in my life.” Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce and singer-songwriter Taylor Swift have traveled to attend each other's football games and concerts.

Kelce arguably answered it months before they  hard-launched their relationship  in October.

The Capuchin Franciscans’ Western American Province celebrated the news on Facebook. The actor reportedly converted to Catholicism after starring in the titular role of Abel Ferrara’s 2020 film, “ Padre Pio.","Shia LaBeouf  has officially joined the  Catholic Church  — and might become a deacon. The “ Transformers ” star, who was  reportedly  confirmed Sunday by Bishop Robert Barron, was celebrated Tuesday in a  Facebook  post by the  Capuchin Franciscans’ Western American Province . LaBeouf was shown smiling alongside robed friars, who were “overjoyed” at his decision. “We are thrilled to share that our dear friend Shia LaBeouf has fully entered the Church this past weekend through the sacrament of confirmation! Advertisement Elsewhere, the post went on to say that LaBeouf’s decision to join the church “is a testament to his sincere desire to grow in his relationship with God and live out the Gospel values.” “As Capuchin Franciscans, we believe in the transformative power of faith and the incredible impact it can have on one’s life. We are humbled and grateful to walk alongside Shia as he takes this important step in his spiritual journey.” LaBeouf was born to a Christian father and Jewish mother; he was both baptized as a child and had a bar mitzvah at 13. In a 2022 interview , LaBeouf told Bishop Barron his Jewish faith “felt fake” because he never properly “invested” in it and was largely committed to the teachings because his grandmother wanted him to. He reportedly converted to Catholicism after starring in the titular role of Abel Ferrara’s 2020 film, “ Padre Pio .” The  eponymous Capuchin friar , who is venerated as a saint, was  purportedly  marked by stigmata. Advertisement LaBeouf’s confirmation sponsor, Brother Alexander Rodriguez,  told the Catholic News Agency  on Wednesday that the actor plans to become a deacon “sometime in the future.” Rodriguez, who starred as a friar in “Pio” and helped LaBeouf prepare for playing the Italian priest, said LaBeouf was inspired during production. Richard Shotwell/Invision/Associated Press In May 2023, LaBeouf  told ChurchPOP  he was enrolled in the Rite of Christian Initiation of Adults and had seven months left to be confirmed into the church. His conversion in 2022, meanwhile, notably arrived after a string of harrowing allegations against him. LaBeouf  was accused in late 2020  by his ex-girlfriend,  FKA Twigs , of “relentless abuse” that allegedly included sexual battery, assault and emotional distress. The actor  told The New York Times  at the time that he has “no excuses” for his alcoholism, “only rationalizations.” Advertisement “I have been abusive to myself and everyone around me for years,” he said.

In court documents  obtained by the New York Post  and publicized Tuesday, Clarkson claims that Blackstock once told her she wasn’t “sexy” enough to join the NBC talent competition series. Advertisement Blackstock ― who, for years, acted as Clarkson’s manager ― also allegedly told her that her public persona was “too similar” to that of another “Voice” coach, country musician  Blake Shelton , and that NBC executives were “looking for a more sex symbol type” like the singer Rihanna. The Post also reports that, when asked about the discussion in court, Clarkson told her lawyer Ed McPherson: “Well, a wife doesn’t forget a time she gets told she’s not a sex symbol, so that stays.”  Clarkson went on to join “The Voice” for Season 14 in 2018 and continued with the show through its 21st season in 2021.

Literally Media, which owns Know Your Meme, Cracked and other brands, acquired Mel for an undisclosed amount. Originally a content site for the Dollar Shave Club, Mel was once  “the rare men’s magazine.”","Men are so back: Mel magazine, an audacious digital media site for the guys, will get a new lease on life next year after its unceremonious dissolution in 2022. Literally Media, which owns Know Your Meme, Cracked and other brands, announced Friday that it acquired Mel magazine for an undisclosed amount. Originally a content site for the Dollar Shave Club, Mel was  once  “the rare men’s magazine that has taken upon itself to investigate masculinity, not enforce it.” Advertisement Oren Katzeff, CEO of Literally Media, told HuffPost that he wanted to acquire Mel for its unique voice and a loyal audience. When you make an acquisition like this, you have to be very respectful of that while also thinking about how to expand and grow the voice into the next chapter of the brand.” Mel doesn’t have an editor-in-chief or any writers yet, but the magazine will start publishing next year. Katzeff said he would like to have three to five people on staff with a mix of full-time and freelance employees and then “grow from there.” Katzeff said he plans to package Mel “with opportunities beyond the articles on site,” which will include a newsletter strategy as well as introducing video, which will open “more doors” to brand deals. Advertisement “There’s really a ripe opportunity for Mel to expand beyond just the website into at the very least video and possibly audio as well,” Katzeff said. “Literally Media as a company years ago was probably doing anywhere from 10 to 15 million video views a month, and now we’re doing in the hundreds of millions. So I’m pretty bullish in terms of Mel’s opportunity in both the video and audio space moving forward.” Mel magazine’s stories included headlines like  “Our Eternal Horniness for the Camp Counselor”  and  “I Tried Mark Wahlberg’s Catholic App to See If It Could Reconnect Me With God.”  Mel magazine reached 4 million unique monthly visitors during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, according to a news release, but in  March 2021, it ceased publication . A few months later, Recurrent Ventures acquired it only to pull the plug in 2022  and lay off all staff members . Mel magazine is the most recent digital media outlet Paste magazine acquired Jezebel , the women’s publication, after it shuttered in November. Katzeff said it’s “more challenging that ever” to run a successful media company. “I think we’ll be seeing more opportunities like these, I think we’ll be seeing more collaborations moving forward,” he said. “And, you know, what I hope with an acquisition like this is that we can also leverage some of the success we’ve had with our other brands to help revive some of the audience on Mel. “I think the power of a network is something that you get to enjoy that you don’t necessarily get as an independent entity. And so, my guess would be as we go into 2024, if the market conditions continue as they are, which is, again, greater challenges in terms of audience, greater challenges in terms of monetization, I think we may see more and more opportunities like these.” Advertisement Support HuffPost The Stakes Have Never Been Higher At HuffPost, we believe that everyone needs high-quality journalism, but we understand that not everyone can afford to pay for expensive news subscriptions.

Nolan decided to use his acceptance speech as an opportunity to wax poetic about why he doesn’t care that an aerobics instructor hurt his feelings. “That’s a couple hours of my life I’ll never get back again!’” Nolan said.,"Christopher Nolan  really felt the burn during a   Peloton  class. The New York Film Critics Circle recently named the filmmaker best director for his movie “Oppenheimer,” and Nolan decided to use his acceptance speech as an opportunity to wax poetic about why he doesn’t care that an aerobics instructor hurt his feelings, according to  Variety . Advertisement To highlight this point, Nolan shared a personal anecdote. That’s a couple hours of my life I’ll never get back again!’” Nolan said. In today’s world, where opinions are everywhere, there is a sort of idea that film criticism is being democratized, but I for one think the critical appreciation of films shouldn’t be an instinct but it should be a profession.”  Although Nolan seemed to be joking while sharing this story, he may have been a bit irked by the flippant remark because he cranked it up again on his appreciation of film critics. “What we have here tonight is a group of professionals who attempt objectivity,” Nolan continued. “Obviously writing about cinema objectively is a paradox, but the aspirations of objectivity is what makes criticism vital and timeless and useful to filmmakers and the filmmaking community.” Advertisement Nolan didn’t name which of his movies was hated on or the name of the hater, but Peloton has a pretty massive fanbase, and it didn’t take long for its members to dig up the evidence. The Redditor appears to be right — and  404 published video of Sherman   absolutely going off on Nolan’s 2020 film, “Tenet.”  In the clip, which 404 says it found on Peloton’s official Facebook group Thursday, Sherman is working out to the song “The Plan” by Travis Scott. What the fuck was going on in that movie? And that’s two-and-a-half hours of my life I want back. I want it back.” So, uh, maybe Nolan has a point about film critics after all — especially when he concluded his speech by saying: “ In today’s world, as filmmakers you can’t hide behind authorial intent.

She wants to halt a $4 million arbitration penalty the show’s producers sought against her in November for allegedly violating a nondisclosure agreement. “I believe Delirium is trying to silence the abuse that occurs behind the cameras and ruin me for telling the truth,” Poche said.","On Tuesday, contestant Renee Poche  filed a lawsuit  against both Netflix and the show’s production company, Delirium TV, claiming “unlawful employment practices” as well as “unfair competition” and “intentional infliction of emotional distress.”  She wants to halt a $4 million arbitration penalty the show’s producers sought against her in November for allegedly violating a nondisclosure agreement by speaking publicly about her experiences on the show. Advertisement “My experience on ‘Love Is Blind’ was traumatic,” Poche, a Texas native who works as a veterinarian,  told Variety on Wednesday . “I felt like a prisoner and had no support when I let Delirium know that I didn’t feel safe.” She went on to note: “I believe Delirium is trying to silence the abuse that occurs behind the cameras and ruin me for telling the truth.” Poche’s screen time on the fifth and most recent season of “Love Is Blind” was relatively brief. However, she was matched up with ex-fiancé Carter Wall, who is described as a “walking red flag” who was “emotionally abusive on and off camera” in court documents  cited by “Entertainment Tonight,”  among other outlets. Though Poche said in the complaint she was “utterly terrified of Wall” and expressed her concerns to Netflix and Delirium TV officials, she claims she was “forced to spend long stretches of time alone with him.” Advertisement To represent her, Poche  has reportedly hired  powerhouse attorneys Mark Geragos ― whose previous clients included Michael Jackson and Winona Ryder ― and Bryan Freedman. Netflix HuffPost reached out to Netflix representatives for comment on the suit but did not hear back as of Thursday night. Over a period of 10 days, the prospective couples go on a series of “dates” from the privacy of individual pods, where they communicate via a speaker but cannot see each other. Advertisement Poche’s case isn’t the first to be filed against “Love Is Blind.” In October, it was reported that Season 5 contestant Tran Dang  had come forward with sexual assault claims  against Thomas Smith, her former fiancé on the show. The show’s creator, Chris Coelen, responded to Dang’s suit by emphasizing the safety measures that were taken during filming. “We do not tell people what to say, what to do, we consistently tell people that this is their journey, this is their life to lead as they choose.

Fake shipping notifications are the top issue, followed by fraudulent products bought online. To avoid losing money, do a gut check with yourself about those deals you spot on the internet.","In a new AARP  survey  of 1,880 U.S. holiday shoppers, 80% of respondents said they’ve encountered holiday fraud, with fake shipping notifications being the top issue (53%), followed by fraudulent products bought through an online ad (38%). But often, you may not know the charity was a scam until it’s too late. Advertisement “A lot of times with charity frauds, victims don’t know that they’re actually a victim,” said Amy Nofziger, the director of victim support for the AARP Fraud Watch Network. “Any good, legitimate charity will take your money today, tomorrow, or the next day,” Nofziger said. “But of course, you either don’t receive the goods and now your payment information is exfiltrated.” To avoid losing money, do a gut check with yourself about those deals you spot on the internet. Nofziger said it’s a red flag if the seller has every size and color available when any other website is sold out of that item. If it’s a seller on Facebook Marketplace, avoid listings that  only list peer-to-peer payment systems  like Venmo, CashApp or Zelle as an option because scammers prefer these untraceable and unretractable forms of payment. Advertisement That’s because scammers are known to tamper with gift cards on display racks and set it up so that  when you register to activate them, the scammer will be notified  and they can spend or transfer the funds before you or your gift recipient can use it. Some scammers impersonate airline customer service agents to get your personal and banking information. Because imposters often make fraudulent airline websites, Nofziger said you should also be wary of clicking airfare links you found via a search engine result and instead should go directly to the airline’s website. And actually, I can offer you a $50 discount if you can get me an Amex [American Express] gift card because we’re running a special with Amex,” Nofziger said as an example. “We’re seeing the injection of malware on merchant checkout pages,” Jabbara said. It also helps to check the seller’s reviews and see if they have had a large number of disputes and chargebacks in the past because that’s a red flag, Jabbara said. “You might get a text message from FedEx or USPS saying that they weren’t able to deliver a package because there was missing information on your account: ‘Just click here to fill the information out, your package will be coming,’” Nofziger said as an example. Beyond avoiding suspiciously misspelled text messages, keep track of what you’re buying to know who delivers your package and when. 10'000 Hours via Getty Images Shipping scams can be incredibly common during the holidays. Your options are more limited if it is with cash or not on a card. “If you’re using a peer-to-peer app or using cash or wire transfer or some of non-card payment method, your recourse is somewhat more limited and undefined,” Jabbara said, noting that whether you get money back will depend on the service’s specific policies, and sometimes “it’s kind of a ‘you’re on your own approach.’” Report the scam to authorities. Help prevent others from getting scammed by filing a complaint with the Federal Trade Commission  online  or calling 877-382-4357.

Setting clear limits for different holiday spending areas will help you avoid making impulse purchases. Emotional spending can be a big problem around the Holiday season, which tends to bring up childhood memories and a sense of pressure.","The holidays are an exciting time for parties, sweet treats, shiny decor and family gatherings. “Maintaining financial boundaries during the holiday season is crucial for several reasons.” Advertisement Stevens emphasized that it’s important to resist the temptation to overspend so you can avoid accumulating debt, foster healthy relationships, minimize stress and model financial responsibility. “I think it’s important to decide on a holiday budget well in advance of the holiday season ― this can include travel, food and gifting expenses,” said Samantha Gorelick, managing financial planner at  Brunch & Budget . “Some folks save all year long for the holiday season, but if you didn’t prepare that far in advance, decide now on an amount you will spend and try your best to stick with it.” Advertisement Setting clear limits for different holiday spending areas will help you avoid making impulse purchases. Doing so can cause you to derail your long-term savings goals.” Make a list (and check it twice). “Put the amount you are willing to spend next to each item and/or person before you start shopping, and please, please update it in with your actual spending as you go,” said Anne Lester, a retirement savings expert and author of the upcoming book  “Your Best Financial Life.” She emphasized how easy it is to spend beyond your means, particularly in this era of apps and browser extensions that effectively gamify the process of purchasing expensive items and experiences. Advertisement “It’s important to set realistic and effective boundaries that will make you consider if the thing you are about to get for yourself or someone on your list is really something that is needed ― or even truly wanted,” Lester said. “With high rates of inflation, don’t feel shame if your holiday season might look different than years past,” Howard said. “There might be less gifts under the tree, but maybe they’re more meaningful this year ― like a coupon book for your significant other or spending time with your family on a service project. We should all extend a little more grace this holiday season when it comes to spending.” Start new traditions. But the internet and social media have made it all too easy to fall into that trap. “I think one of the reasons that it becomes easy to violate or ignore financial boundaries is because of the value we’ve been taught spending and overspending on gifts means, as it relates to showing care and showing love,” Stevens said. “In other words, we’ve been taught by the media and our peers that spending equals love, when that’s not necessarily true.” Take the time to consider the beliefs and values you developed growing up, and whether you want to carry them into your holiday spending as an adult. Additionally, each of my kids will receive up to three gifts and one of the gifts will be something that can be used on vacation.” Advertisement Avoid emotional spending. “When it comes to setting financial boundaries this holiday season, be hyper-aware of emotional triggers, social pressure, [fear of missing out] and today’s gift-giving culture,” Howard said. “If you are overspending, explore where you learned this behavior and dig for the root issue behind the spending.” Emotional spending can be a big problem around the holiday season, which tends to bring up childhood memories and a sense of pressure to achieve Hallmark-style “perfection.” “If you feel a rush from shopping, understand your purpose of spending,” Howard said. “Protecting yourself from yourself might look like knowing exactly what gifts you’re buying for others, or only shopping online to reduce extra purchases in store.” Prepare to save after the holidays. So, after the holidays, make a conscious effort to spend less than usual for a couple of months to make up for any overspending during the holidays.” Advertisement Think about your future self. “Think about the dreams you are working towards and how the decision of saving that money today instead will help you get there faster, instead of spending it on a portable monitor or a spin scrubber on TikTok Shop, no matter how many coupons they give you!” she said. “I can’t emphasize enough how important it is to think about taking good care of your future self as well as your current self.” Do you have info to share with HuffPost reporters?",2023-11-28 10:45:01,"[0.16469882410678668, 0.4718307652108243, 0.1314998653929961, 0.11281740631385949, 0.8486636816623221]",,The-1-Thing-You-Need-To-Do-Before-You-Start-Holiday-Shopping-This-Year.wav

Here’s How To Spot The Toxic Spending Habit.,"""Spaving"" is the act of spending money to save money. Sales create a sense of urgency with buzzy terms like “one day only,” “limited time, “daily deal” and “flash sale” Avoid sale alerts or bricks-and-mortar stores that tempt your spaving impulses.","But other practices are more sneakily harmful ― like “spaving.” “Spaving is the act of spending money to save money,”  Andrea Woroch , a consumer finance and budgeting expert, told HuffPost. “The problem with spaving is that it can trick you into spending more in order to receive a certain savings benefit in return,” said Jacqueline Howard, the head of money wellness at Ally Bank. “Because of the incentive, it’s easy to feel better about adding a few more items to your cart, even if you weren’t planning on making those additional purchases,” Howard explained. Woroch noted that sales create a sense of urgency with buzzy terms like “one day only,” “limited time, “daily deal” and “flash sale” ― making customers feel like they’ll waste a rare opportunity if they don’t pounce. “The reality is, retailers are constantly rolling out new sales, so just because you miss out on a sale today doesn’t mean you can’t get the same item on sale later,” she explained. Many people also feel a sort of high when they score a good deal on an item, regardless of how much they wanted or needed it in the first place. “Even if you get something at a really good sale price, you’re still spending money that could be going towards something more important, like building your savings, paying down debt, investing, etc.,” Woroch said. “A few bucks here and there adds up and can put a huge dent in your overall budget.” Then there’s the fact that sale items often come with limited or nonexistent return policies. Advertisement For some people, spaving leads to credit card debt, which can mean paying interest that far exceeds whatever was saved in the sales deal. Remove the temptation to spave by avoiding sale alerts however possible. “Create a list before you go shopping and stick to it,” Howard suggested. Plus, you can look around your home or closet to see if you already have something like it — because if you do, even another $10 is unnecessary to spend.” She recommended implementing a 24-hour waiting period to confirm that you don’t have the item or something similar, as well as to shop around, compare prices or even look for a refurbished option. Ask yourself, how will you feel about this purchase in three, six or nine months from now?” Westend61 via Getty Images Try to avoid sale alerts or bricks-and-mortar stores that tempt your spaving impulses. “Stay out of stores that have too many deal temptations,” Woroch said. And be on alert whenever you have to shop in person. “Use browser tools that do the deal hunting for you so you don’t get tempted by another sale when looking for a relevant coupon.” She recommended  PriceBlink , which runs an instant price comparison when you’re looking at a product online and presents other sites that are selling the same item for less, as well as  Sidekick  from  CouponCabin . “The time it takes you to fetch your credit card, the urge to buy should pass, helping you avoid an unnecessary purchase.” Advertisement Do a spending audit. “It’s also a good idea to take a look at just how much you’ve spent over the year so far on excess purchases, which can be eye-opening and give you a little fuel to make changes.” She also recommended thinking about the emotions driving your impulse spaving purchases. “Every time you’re tempted to spave, just think about how that money can go towards helping you reach your goal faster.” Advertisement Stop comparing yourself with others. “When we compare our experiences to that of others, we often lose sight of our values and overspend.” You’ve likely heard the expression “keeping up with the Joneses,” which speaks to the social pressure that many people feel to buy things.",2023-11-09 10:45:00,"[0.19030965122998172, 0.1294552947317662, 0.10357155330156265, 0.07855192444021256, 0.9644304494509052]",,Are-You-Guilty-Of-Spaving-Heres-How-To-Spot-The-Toxic-Spending-Habit.wav

For Lopez, working alone helps her efficiently gather insights and data before she has to be in a team setting. Lopez said that managers can also misconstrue Gen Z colleagues not showing up to the office as a lack of team spirit. Gen Zers might prefer doing things solo because they work in a judgmental environment.","“But other than that, if I can do it by myself, I will 99% of the time just prefer to do things by myself.” Advertisement For Lopez, working alone helps her efficiently gather insights and data before she has to be in a team setting, and allows her to finish work on time. I honestly prefer to preserve my energy and over-communicate when it’s drastically needed.” Why Gen Z Prefers More Solo Work At work, Gen Zers’ independence can sometimes create the negative reputation that they are disengaged from the rest of their team. When asked, Gen Z workers said that there is more nuance in why they might want to work alone than these generalized findings suggest. But at the same time, he appreciates when there are colleagues around, too. He said Gen Zers might prefer doing things solo because they work in a judgmental environment. They might be in a workplace where they cannot listen to music uninterrupted, or where eating a snack during a meeting could cause colleagues to think, “Oh, is this really the time to be eating?” With other colleagues present, “you kind of have that magnifying glass on you,” he said. Lopez said that managers can also misconstrue Gen Z colleagues not showing up to the office as a lack of team spirit. What Gen Z And Older Generations Can Learn From Each Other Fernandez said that there should be flexibility for remote work and working alone, but said it can also be helpful for Gen Z professionals to know that “you cannot be efficient with people. As logical as we are, we are emotional beings.” Advertisement Even though it can be inefficient, physically showing up at work can increase relationship-building, and it’s “where you learn to manage dysfunctional teammates, where you learn to negotiate or, frankly, even influence others about your idea,” she said. Guevara said that when he advises Gen Z friends who work remotely and alone, he asks them to separate the situations where it’s comfortable to work alone versus where it’s necessary. “If you need music to work, that’s one thing,” he said. In a 2022 Gallup  poll , Gen Z was the demographic most ambivalent and disengaged with the workplace, but it was not because young workers were slacking off and not caring about their jobs. Most reported missing a close connection to their colleagues, manager or employer. When Fernandez teaches university students, she said that she asks for class volunteers to be her internal focus group, so they can tell her what’s working and what’s not in the classroom. “[Gen Z is] going to be the next set of managers,” Fernandez said. “There’s that preconceived notion that ‘Gen Z is lazy, Gen Z doesn’t like working with other people’ that they’ll use to influence how they approach a situation with someone who happens to be Gen Z.” Advertisement Guevara said that he has Gen Z friends who “get talked down to” by others at work, “as if they don’t know what they’re talking about.” “The way that they talk to people is obviously going to have an impact, especially when there’s a huge age difference,” he said.

The Lazy Girl Job This year marked a turning point for how younger professionals are setting their work expectations. Instead, there was the rise of “lazy girl jobs.” In a May  TikTok video , Gabrielle Judge ― a content creator who popularized the term ― defined “lazy girl jobs” as positions where you can have “pretty comfortable salaries, and not do that much work and be remote.”   @gabrielle_judge   Career advice for women who don’t know what remote job to apply to. Women are here to collect those pay checks and move on from the work day. #corporatejobs   #jobsearchhacks   #remoteworking   #antihustleculture   #9to5     ♬ original sound - Anti Work Girlboss     As Judge previously  told  HuffPost: “A ‘lazy girl job’ mindset is all about creating as much freedom and space in your personal life as possible through efficient work days, although not everyone will understand.” Advertisement The LGJ’s wide appeal on TikTok speaks to how professionals are redefining success. Voluntelling If you’ve been quote-unquote “volunteered” for an assignment you didn’t ask for, you’ve actually been “voluntold.” It’s a phrase that was  popularized  by the U.S. military to describe situations where somebody is volunteered for a task without getting the opportunity to say “no,” and with implicit pressure to say “yes.” At work, these assignments may not sound exactly like marching orders, but deep down, you know they are. Advertisement A term like “‘hey’ hanging” perfectly describes the anxiety co-workers may be causing with their messages. Advertisement This summer, more tech employees  complained  that they received these “reassignment” orders from employers. “I don’t see it as ever being a good thing for an employee,” Rahbar warned. “If it were to happen to me, the first thing I would do is probably start my job search immediately for something that did suit my skills where I would be a better fit.” 6. Body Doubling If you work best with an accountability buddy, try a work exercise known as “ body doubling .” With this technique, commonly used by professionals with ADHD, you do a task and have another person on Zoom or in person doing a task too. You might already be doing body doubling without knowing it has a name. It can mean working quietly with a friend in a coffee shop, or it can mean having them finish the same task as you at the same time. Either way, try out this hack if you have trouble concentrating or finishing tasks. Post-Work Restraint Collapse If you’ve ever felt like screaming into a pillow or lying on your couch after a hard day at work, you might be feeling something known as “ post-work restraint collapse .” It’s a concept that therapists are using to describe the bone-deep exhaustion caused by draining work days. Post-work restraint collapse can look like “a sense of depletion and having nothing left for other activities, even things that you might really enjoy, like exercise, spending time with your family or other social activities,”  Emily Treichler , a licensed clinical psychologist, previously told HuffPost about post-work restraint collapse.

Ange Postecoglou has settled on his first choice deeper-lying central midfield pairing of Yves Bissouma and Pape Sarr.,"I n pre-season, Tanguy Ndombele was the Tottenham player tipped to be handed another chance by Ange Postecoglou. Mauricio Pochettino, José Mourinho and Antonio Conte have all failed to manage the midfielder. Nothing changed under Postecoglou, and  Spurs’ club-record signing  was  shipped off to Galatasaray  on loan. Giovani Lo Celso could have fallen into the same bracket but the Argentinian has gone from forgotten midfielder to key man in a few short weeks. Few could have foreseen Lo Celso having such an impact at the  Tottenham Hotspur  Stadium this season. However, Lo Celso faced a number of hurdles in order to re-establish himself at Spurs. Postecoglou has also settled on his first choice deeper-lying central midfield pairing of Yves Bissouma and Pape Sarr. With Rodrigo Bentancur and Oliver Skipp also on the books, Postecoglou isn’t short of central midfield options and he had a settled XI up until November. Then disaster struck as Spurs played out a  4-1 loss at home to Chelsea , ending with nine players on the pitch. Maddison sustained an ankle injury  and hasn’t played since. Lo Celso scored Spurs’ goal in the 2-1 defeat to Unai Emery’s side, remarkably just his second Premier League strike following his 2019 arrival from Real Betis, and followed that up with a goal in  the entertaining 3-3 draw at Manchester City  last month. A brace of assists in the  3-1 win over Bournemouth  on New Year’s Eve confirmed what a number of supporters already suspected – when fit, Lo Celso needs to start. Postecoglou already has his settled midfield trio but there is an argument to suggest Lo Celso can play every midfield role in the Australian’s system rather than be pigeonholed into one specific position. As noted against Bournemouth, Lo Celso is able to pry apart defences superbly. Photograph: Lee Smith/Action Images/Reuters Only Maddison (3.1) is averaging more key passes per 90 minutes than Lo Celso (2.4) of all Spurs players this season. It’s worth noting too that the former is on set-piece duties when fit which has boosted his numbers with the latter able to provide the chances for teammates from open play, which is key for a Spurs side that boasts speedy attacking outlets. Against Villa and City, meanwhile, Lo Celso was deployed in a deeper role. Indeed, only Bissouma (3.7) is making more tackles per 90 minutes than Lo Celso (3.5) of all players for the north London side in England’s top tier this term. He’s already used their respective absences to his advantage. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to  Football Daily Free daily newsletter Kick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of football Privacy Notice:  Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.",2024-01-05 08:00:28,"[0.05065500034493516, 0.05182006074973387, 0.03884013775534507, 0.9959987409712103, 0.035024333353516755]",,Giovani-Lo-Celso-has-gone-from-Spurs-forgotten-midfielder-to-their-key-man.wav

Captain David Warner will miss the match after losing his baggy green cap. Australia will go in with an unchanged XI, backing their senior players to get the job done. World Test Championship points are still on the line.","“Warner Week has started,” said Australian captain Patrick Cummins. Had Pakistan squared the series 1-1 by converting their chances to win in Melbourne, then the retirement of a cricketing fixture after 112 Tests would have had to share billing with this match being a decider. That much was evident from Cummins’ press conference, where he fielded 13 questions about Warner compared to 11 questions about anything else. And that was before Warner went public with the tale that his baggy green cap had been either lost or stolen in transit from Melbourne, prompting an invitation from Schapelle Corby to swap notes about experiences with Qantas baggage handlers. Somehow he has always found a way to become the story. New cap or not, Australia will need a performance from Warner for reasons beyond symbolism, hoping he can turn on the runs one more time at the venue where he once raided Pakistan for a century by lunch on day one. World Test Championship points are still on the line for this match, and as Cummins pointed out, Australia has already had some deducted for slow over rates in England. Not that this has made them speed up their work on the field since, mind you. Hence Australia will go in with an unchanged XI, backing their senior players to get the job done, and lucky to have their three first-choice fast bowlers fit and firing. “All three of us are really fresh,” said Cummins. It’s all gone pretty smoothly so far.” And hence Pakistan spent the day arguing over changes. Their captain Shan Masood arrived at his press conference half an hour late, delayed by debates over team selection that still weren’t resolved by that point, with a team being announced several hours later. Largely this involved keenness to include the chaos factor of leg-spinner Abrar Ahmed, who has taken bags of wickets in his half dozen matches since debuting a year ago, though often at a heavy cost of runs. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to  Australia Sport Free newsletter Get a daily roundup of the latest sports news, features and comment from our Australian sports desk Privacy Notice:  Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties. after newsletter promotion Desperate for a cutting edge, and tempted by the memory of Sydney as a spin venue, Pakistan wanted to give him every chance to recover from injury, but eventually had to give that up. India back in 2004 led the way with 705 for 7 declared. Local curators have been working this season to add some pep to their Sheffield Shield pitches, and the Test strip the day before the game did have appealing patches of green grass, but that has happened before and proved to be an illusion. Saim was listed to open by the Pakistan board’s press release, but it’s just as likely that he will bat in the middle order with Masood to open. Warner’s best farewell, said Cummins, “would be a hundred and maybe a leg spinner to take the last wicket of the game out of the rough.” He did mean a delivery bowled by Warner, an unlikely prospect given Warner hasn’t sent down an over in a Test match since 2016, but the phrase could equally be read to mean any leg-spin bowler.

The Spurs have struggled this season without a true point guard in their starting lineup. Wemby and Scoot Henderson are slated to face off again in Texas on 26 January.,"Unless your name is  Magic Johnson , the first year of one’s career portends struggle, heartbreak and mistakes aplenty. It’s about what one does with those hard times that matters most. “Just try not to skip any steps – and coach,” said Popovich when asked what it takes to build his roster and No 1 pick into a winner ahead of Thursday night’s game. I feel like the game is kind of slowing down for him. And he’s studying more and more.” While the two rooks have long roads ahead, there has already been a great deal of praise for what they can do as young stars in the league. On Halloween night, Wemby  dueled with all-timer Kevin Durant  and the Phoenix Suns, coming out victorious for one of San Antonio’s few wins this year. “[Like] what’s an appropriate time for a three, and not,” Pop noted. But the team’s biggest problem is that it doesn’t have a true point guard in its starting lineup, with no player on the team averaging more than five assists per game. Wemby, who is listed at 209lbs, also needs to put on weight, some say. “He’s obviously a generational player,” former Spurs head coach Bob Hill told the Guardian. While Thursday saw him score his career high with 25 points, he was also responsible for six turnovers in the game, which opened with a 28-6 Spurs run in the first quarter. Wembanyama didn’t help that cause Thursday, notching seven blocks, including several on Scoot’s attempts. It’s worth noting, too, that Wemby and Henderson aren’t the only two standout rookies this year. 2 pick in the latest draft, is averaging about 15 points per game and Oklahoma City’s star center Chet Holmgren, who sat out last year due to injury, is averaging better than 17 points and nearly three blocks and eight rebounds per game in his first official year—doing it on a winning team. After hitting the hook, Wemby followed it up quickly with a made three-pointer. My confidence [is] still the same, I think, just more [of it]. Just me getting more comfortable with the reps.” And how might he look to continue his progress? So, continue to chop at it and get better.” Henderson, who could easily be mistaken for a Marvel superhero if dropped into some other context, says his “ability to fly [up court], speed, strength, all that” have also taken leaps and bounds. Coach Popovich says he’s on a mandated minutes restriction and he can’t play back-to-backs for a couple of weeks until the team takes another look at his foot. But while fans didn’t get to see Wemby and Scoot take the court together for a second straight night on Friday, the two are slated to  match up again in Texas  on 26 January.",2024-01-02 09:00:55,"[0.0617829377469183, 0.07833846580534468, 0.04964433842591844, 0.9927670273208237, 0.04466567480127562]",,Victor-Wembanyama-and-Scoot-Henderson-clash-offers-peek-at-NBAs-future.wav

Newcastle have lost seven of the past eight games. The Magpies travel to Sunderland in the FA Cup third round on Saturday. Eddie Howe's side also face Manchester City and Aston Villa in January.,"The rain fell incessantly over Anfield as  Liverpool  and Newcastle staged a madcap contest that ended with Eddie Howe staring at January being the cruellest month for his job prospects. This was  a 4-2 shellacking  from Jürgen Klopp’s side that might have been 8-2. Put another way: the football project of Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund has lost seven of the past eight and their next three scheduled outings before February arrives appear as treacherous as this trip to Anfield. On Saturday it is the half-hour drive to Sunderland in the FA Cup third round ahead of league fixtures against Manchester City (home) and Aston Villa (away). Being knocked out of the last competition Newcastle can claim this season by their fiercest rivals at their ground would cause alarm in the plush offices of Howe’s paymasters. Go down or draw when the champions are in town (13 January) and at Villa (30 January), who are three points behind Liverpool after this victory, and Howe would be staring at one win in 11 matches. This is not the form of an upwardly mobile team owned by a nation state whose wish is to burnish their global reputation by transforming Newcastle into a continental heavyweight. At the break Howe and his men could still dream of beginning 2024 with the right result, but this was only because Liverpool produced a curate’s egg of a first half. The poor part was how they failed to end it three or four ahead. The statistic that crystallised this was the 18 shots of Klopp’s side with no goals: their most in eight years in an opening 45 minutes without scoring. Newcastle’s players look dejected after Curtis Jones puts Liverpool 2-1 up. Photograph: Jan Kruger/Getty Images Newcastle have not won here since 1994 when Andy Cole and Rob Lee struck in a 2-0 triumph that April. This was two years before Kevin Keegan’s infamous “I will love it” rant in 1995-96, the last season Newcastle were serious contenders. Coming into this game Howe’s mood music had been odd. He was hinting this was because of those missing but as the world’s richest club there is not, surely, copious sympathy out there for an injury list added to by Kieran Trippier and Callum Wilson being unable to travel. This put those unavailable into double figures but Howe could still send out an XI that featured Alexander Isak as a striker (in Wilson’s position, he equalised) and the impressive Tino Livramento at right-back (Trippier’s). skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to  Football Daily Free daily newsletter Kick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of football Privacy Notice:  Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties. after newsletter promotion After only four minutes the pass count was 28-2 to Liverpool and close to seven were needed before Newcastle had the ball in Liverpool territory.

Owens not only claimed victory in sports but also championed the unyielding spirit of equality and athleticism, leaving an indelible mark on history. The stage was set in Kinshasa, an arena pulsating with anticipation and uncertainty. Foreman, known for his brutal power and dominant performances, was expected to overwhelm Ali. While absorbing punishing blows, Ali preserved his energy and exploited Foreman’s exhaustion. This match went beyond boxing; it symbolized resilience, strategy, and the triumph of intellect over sheer might. Ali’s victory echoed far beyond the ring, becoming a metaphor for overcoming insurmountable odds through wit, perseverance, and tactical brilliance. Babe Ruth, the larger-than-life figure known for his home run prowess, stepped up to bat amid a charged atmosphere. With the count at two strikes, Ruth stood poised against Cubs pitcher Charlie Root. For 14 grueling rounds, Ali and Frazier exchanged punishing blows, each refusing to yield. Ali, summoning every ounce of his resilience, launched a ferocious assault in the 15th round, battering Frazier relentlessly. During a quarter-final match against England, Maradona etched his name in football folklore.

However, a statement was released shortly by La Liga after Messi’s declaration. The statement said that the clause needs to be paid if Messi is to be allowed to leave Barcelona. Jorge Messi claims the massive clause which  Barcelona  added in his son’s contract as insurance has expired at the end of last season. If Jorge could prove this as the case, the Argentine international could leave the club for free this month, should all parties reach an agreement. Lionel Messi mentioned his urged to leave Barca in an official note. Following that, didn’t show in the club’s training after new manager Ronald Koeman was signed. The scene has led to Messi’s father traveling to Spain this week for talks with Barcelona president Josep Maria Bartomeu and the club hierarchy over a possible exit. Jorge Messi statement Jorge released a statement on behalf of his son. The statement said We don’t know what contract they have seen and analyzed to back the claims only the buyout clause is applicable even if the player decides to unilaterally terminate his contract after the 2019/2020. This must be a major error on their own part. He added by saying, It is obvious that the compensation of €700m doesn’t apply at all. La Liga said it had analyzed the player’s contract which remained valid with an active release clause. And Messi won’t leave the club if the clause is not been paid. Messi claimes he triggered an exit clause in his contract which he could do as soon as the season finished. Barcelona claimed the clause has expired before June 10. The Argentine international is not short of suitors but there are few clubs who have the financial capability to sign him. Manchester City is the only club that has shown huge interest and seems to be the possible place for Messi.

At the same time, corporate rate cuts are made permanent under the bill. By 2027 a large majority of people making less than $200,000 will either see little change in their tax bill or a tax increase.","Tax moves to make before 2018   First, the good news. A lot of households under the  GOP tax plan , which President Trump is set to sign into law this week, will see a lower tax bill in the next several years. The nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation estimates that in 2019, more than half of filers making $40,000 and up will see an average tax cut greater than $500. That trend holds for income groups over $50,000    The Tax Institute at H&R Block provided some scenarios of people with young children, for instance, who could see their  tax burden drop  by roughly $2,000    But here's the thing: After 2025, all individual tax cuts are set to expire. At the same time, corporate rate cuts are made permanent under the bill. As a result, by 2027 a large majority of people making less than $200,000 will either see little change in their tax bill or a tax increase relative to what they pay today, the JCT estimates. Related: Try the CNN tax calculator to see how you may fare under GOP bill       Republicans made individual tax cuts temporary so they could meet budget rules that let them pass their tax overhaul with no Democratic votes. But don't worry, they say. A future Congress won't let middle class tax cuts expire. Recent precedents -- like the oft-extended Bush tax cuts -- suggest they may be right. Still, there's zero guarantee of that. After all, a lot can change over eight years. In any case, there's another reason you could end up with a tax increase after 2025. While the cuts are temporary, the GOP tax bill makes permanent another key provision that tax expert Lily Batchelder has described as a ""stealth tax increase"" for individuals, the effects of which will grow over time. The money it will raise is a big reason why the cost of the permanent corporate tax cuts will be paid for in the second decade, according to Batchelder, a tax law professor at New York University. Related: What's in the final GOP tax plan      The GOP plan introduces a new, slower inflation measure called chained CPI that will apply to inflation-adjusted parts of the tax code. So, for example, the income ranges that apply to each of the seven income tax rates will grow more slowly. So will the value of many tax credits and the income phaseout thresholds for various tax breaks. Those thresholds dictate whether you make too much money to qualify for certain breaks.

Plus, some individuals will end up paying even more. The Tax Institute at H&R Block ran a number of scenarios for filers in different situations to give a more specific gauge of where you might stand in 2018 if you're a wage earner. In the next several years, plenty of filers are likely to see a tax cut of some kind, although not everyone will be quite so lucky. But  t he story will change as the decade rolls on because individual tax cuts would expire after 2025. Related: What's in the GOP's final tax plan      Here's just a sampling of how people in different situations may fare next year. Keep in mind, these scenarios do not delve into the more complex provisions of the Republican plan that, for instance, taxes a filer's business income at a lower rate than their wage income. Much more needs to be unpacked by experts as to how that will play out for different filers. Nor do they take into account the potential effects of other provisions in the tax bill -- such as  eliminating the penalty for not buying health insurance  -- or any future spending cuts that may be made to help offset the cost of the tax bill. Family of four in San Diego, Calif.      -- $150,000 income    -- Married couple with two children under 17  -- Homeowners  -- Itemized deductions today total $22,000 ($7,000 state/local income tax; $5,000 property tax; $8,000 mortgage interest; $2,000 charitable contributions)    The family would save an estimated $3,559 in federal income taxes:  They would no longer itemize, opting instead to take the nearly doubled     Related: See new tax brackets for 2018 under today's law vs. GOP tax plan      The Tax Institute ran another example of a married couple in Houston -- with three kids under 17 -- also making $150,000 and found they'd save a little more ($3,771) on their tax bill for the same reasons. Head of household in Kansas City, Mo. -- $45,000 income    -- Single parent with two children under 17  -- Renter  -- Takes standard deduction today of $9,550    The family would save an estimated $1,802 in federal income taxes:  The standard deduction for heads of households nearly doubles to $18,000. The family's top tax rate of 15% falls to 12%. The Tax Institute ran another scenario of a single parent with three kids under 17 in Los Angeles making $75,000. That family would save $2,560 for the same reasons. Single person in Queens, N.Y.     -- $120,000 income    -- No kids  -- Homeowner (co-op)  -- Itemized deductions totaling $22,500 ($10,000 state/local income tax; $5,000 property tax; $6,000 mortgage interest; $1,500 charitable contributions)    The person would save an estimated $101 in federal income taxes:  While . Single person in Westminster, Colo.      -- $70,000 income    -- No kids  -- Homeowner  --$10,000 in unreimbursed business expenses  -- Itemized deductions totaling $19,600 ($2,500 state and local income tax; $3,500 property taxes; $5,000 in mortgage interest deduction; $8,600 in unreimbursed employee business expenses, since filers are only allowed to deduct those expenses in excess of 2% of AGI). The person would pay  an estimated  $1,484 more in federal income taxes:  Even though this filer's top tax rate falls to 22% from 25% currently, he would no longer be able to deduct any unreimbursed business expenses under the GOP bill, so he would end up taking the $12,000 standard deduction instead of itemizing. Single person in New York City      -- $500,000 income    -- No kids  -- Homeowner  -- Itemized deductions totaling $135,000 ($46,000 state/local tax; $24,000 property tax; $55,000 mortgage interest; $10,000 charitable contributions) but capped at $128,001 due to a limitation in the current code for high earners.
