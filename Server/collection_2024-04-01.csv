At the end of the game, the mascot was lowered into what appeared to be a giant toaster. The bottom of the toaster apparatus opened up and spit out a version of the mascot made out of edible Pop Tart material.","College football got a little weirder than usual on Thursday during the Pop-Tart Bowl ― an annual December game that’s undergone numerous name changes over the past three decades. This year’s game,  in which Kansas State beat North Carolina State  28-19, involved a bug-eyed, human-sized Pop Tart mascot. Advertisement At the end of the game, the mascot brandished a sign reading, “DREAMS REALLY DO COME TRUE” before being lowered into what appeared to be a giant toaster. Donna Summer’s “Hot Stuff” blared in the background. The bottom of the toaster apparatus opened up and spit out a version of the mascot (with no human actor inside ― we hope) made out of edible Pop-Tart material. Kansas State players grabbed at the anthropomorphic Pop-Tart’s body and shoved bits of him into their mouths in a celebratory fashion. And some people highlighted the gruesome, jammy aftermath. Advertisement But don’t feel bad for the Pop-Tart. Reporter Rodger Sherman  confirmed with the mascot  prior to its toasty demise that the breakfast pastry indeed yearned to be eaten.

Lauren Boebert ’s (R-Colo.)  decision to change  to a less competitive congressional district. “From a party perspective, we certainly don’t think it was the best move,” Dave Williams told  CNN ’s  Brianna Keilar  on Thursday. “We felt that she was best suited for Congressional District 3 and that she was in the best position to win reelection and retain that for Republicans.” Advertisement He said the lawmaker has “a serious challenge on her hands trying to explain to the voters of CD 4 why she thought it was necessary to leave CD 3 and have a better chance at keeping her seat in Congress.” He added, “It’s kind of a problematic proposition, but it’s again, it’s something for the voters to decide.” Boebert announced Wednesday she was entering the GOP primary for retiring Rep. Ken Buck’s seat in the state’s east, leaving the district she won by a hair last year. She said it would be a “fresh start” because it has been a “pretty difficult year for me and my family.” The move allows her to skirt a likely rematch against Democrat Adam Frisch, whose campaign has significantly outraised Boebert’s.

Christie says Haley's Civil War remarks show she lacks backbone to lead the country. Haley walked it back on Thursday morning, telling a New Hampshire radio station, “of course the Civil War was about slavery. We know that.”","Chris Christie  criticized his fellow Republican presidential hopeful  Nikki Haley  on Thursday over her  failure to say slavery  was the cause of the American Civil War, claiming she did so because “she’s unwilling to offend anyone by telling the truth.” “She’s smart and she knows better. I know her well, and I don’t believe Nikki has a racist bone in her body,” the former New Jersey governor said at a town hall event in Epping, New Hampshire. Advertisement “The reason she did it is just as bad, if not worse, and should make everybody concerned about her candidacy,” he continued. “She did it because she’s unwilling to offend anyone by telling the truth.” Christie suggested the incident demonstrates that Haley lacks backbone to lead the country and stand up against tough foreign leaders,  Democrats , and certain divisive  Republicans , accusing her of being “afraid to say that  Donald Trump  is unfit because she’s afraid of offending people who support Donald Trump.” Unlike most of his rivals, Christie has been vocally critical of the former president, who faces 91 felony counts across four indictments. Advertisement At a Wednesday night campaign stop in Berlin, New Hampshire, a voter asked Haley to state the cause of the Civil War. Haley cited the role of government, and “freedoms,” but declined to mention slavery. Facing fierce backlash, Haley walked it back on Thursday morning, telling a New Hampshire radio station, “of course the Civil War was about slavery. We know that.” She also declined, when asked by a voter on Thursday, to explicitly rule out  being Trump’s vice president , and said she  would pardon  the former president if she wins the election and if he’s convicted of a crime. “Since she won’t deny it, we have to believe that she’s willing to do it,” Christie said of Haley’s aspirations for a potential second Trump administration. Some of Haley’s other rivals have also criticized her viral Civil War remarks. Ron DeSantis told reporters,  according to the Des Moines Register . Advertisement Vivek Ramaswamy, with whom Haley has  clashed  repeatedly on foreign policy,  tweeted : “Turns out Nikki knows as little about the Civil War as she does about the Ukraine War.” Haley has seen a polling bump recently, including a surge in New Hampshire, but she still lags Trump, who leads the pack by a wide margin nationally.

Mr Marriott's death was ""tragic"" and the ""thoughts and prayers"" of church members were with his family, they added.

More than 160 people were injured as Russia hit Kyiv, Odesa, Dnipropetrovsk, Kharkiv and Lviv in the early hours of Friday morning. Russia ""used nearly every type of weapon in its arsenal"", with homes and a maternity hospital hit, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said. Ukraine's air force said it had never seen so many missiles launched at once. Kyiv's air defences have drastically improved in recent months, but on Friday they were overwhelmed. An Air Force spokesperson said Russia used hypersonic, cruise and ballistic missiles, including X-22 type, which are difficult to intercept. The air force said 114 of 158 missiles and drones had been shot down. For months, mostly falling debris caused the damage and loss of life that Ukrainians constantly fear. Once again, it wasn't just Kyiv picking up the pieces either. Authorities claimed more than 10 Iranian-made Shahed drones and 15 missiles targeted the western city of Lviv, somewhere which has often been spared the worst of this invasion. Kharkiv mayor Igor Terekhov said three people were killed and 13 were injured in a series of strikes on the city which damaged a hospital and residential buildings. The governor of Dnipropetrovsk region said that six people were killed and 28 were injured in what he called a ""tragic morning for the region"". One Russian missile even briefly entered Polish airspace as it homed in on its Ukrainian target. Its missile stockpiles aren't what they were, but Moscow has shown it still wants to continue its tactic of suppressing Ukraine's population, in the hope that not feeling safe will lessen their appetite for this war. It's also been a week when Ukraine destroyed a major Russian landing ship in occupied Crimea, and the US delivered the last of its approved military packages to Ukraine worth $250m. Responding to the latest Russian bombardment, US President Joe Biden described it as ""a stark reminder to the world that, after nearly two years of this devastating war, Putin's objective remains unchanged. Maybe the renewed missile attack was revenge, or another statement? A spokesman for Russia's Defence Ministry simply said ""all the designated military targets have been hit"".

So what does it mean for next year's general election? Colorado's highest court issued a similar, unprecedented, ruling just days earlier. But it is still uncertain whether Mr Trump's name will appear on the ballot when the two states pick their Republican candidate in the coming months, as both rulings are on hold while an appeals process plays out. Section 3 disqualifies people who engage in ""insurrection or rebellion"" from holding federal office. Her order said Mr Trump ""over the course of several months and culminating on January 6 2021, used a false narrative of election fraud to inflame his supporters and direct them to the Capitol"". Ms Bellows, an elected official, was accused of making a politically motivated decision by the Trump campaign. On 19 December,  the Colorado Supreme Court said  it found ""clear and convincing evidence that President Trump engaged in insurrection"". It was the first time Section 3 had been used to disqualify a presidential candidate. They also noted that Mr Trump has not been charged with inciting insurrection. These rulings only apply to Colorado and Maine respectively. Hours after Maine's ruling, California's elected secretary of state, a Democrat, ignored calls to remove Mr Trump from the state's Republican primary ballot - saying it was a matter for the courts. In both Colorado and Maine, Joe Biden won against Donald Trump in 2020 by a wide margin, and it is unlikely that Mr Trump will need to win the states to enter the White House once more. Any decision by the US Supreme Court could supersede this and apply nationally. The balance of that court has shifted to more conservative in recent years, thanks in part to three justices who were appointed by Mr Trump when he was president. The Colorado Supreme Court disagreed, and top legal scholars are divided on whether this law should apply to Mr Trump. Lawyers for Mr Trump dispute that he engaged in insurrection and argue his remarks to supporters on the day of the 2021 riot were protected by his right to free speech. But there could be wider implications for the general election. Dozens of other US states have similar lawsuits trying to bar Mr Trump from running, and the decisions in Colorado and Maine could make it more likely some of them succeed. If Mr Trump was stopped from running in a state where he and Mr Biden are neck-and-neck, that could be critical in a presidential race that is expected to be closely fought.",2023-12-29 14:33:30,"[0.11186714605195681, 0.09556231207458032, 0.980654614459517, 0.09255421388132863, 0.09002127957997569]",,Can-Donald-Trump-still-run-for-president-after-Maine-and-Colorado-rulings?.wav

It is not clear yet whether the death was caused by food. Officials say investigations are continuing into any common links between cases and the recalled cheeses.

Symptoms of STEC infection can vary in severity, ranging from mild diarrhoea to severe abdominal cramps, vomiting and bloody diarrhoea. In up to 15% of cases, infection can lead to the development of haemolytic uraemic syndrome (HUS) - a serious and life-threatening condition predominantly affecting the kidneys, which can result in death.

And there is no better example of that old adage than Blackpool Tower and the fire that never was. On Thursday, six fire engines, a drone team and a rope-rescue team gathered at the famous landmark tower built more than 100 years ago. Social media videos were rapidly notching up views. That was until police flying over the tower in a helicopter  declared ""there is no fire"". The flames, it turned out, were in fact orange netting flapping about in the wind, leaving some red faces and quite possibly a mini-surge in opticians' bookings. The discovery in January 2021 led to a search by officers and specialists dogs, only for it to be confirmed  the suspected foot was actually a potato  with a mushroom growing next to it. 'Ritual mass murder'  The yoga room was dark and lit with candles One September night this year, two dog walkers peered through a window into a dark cafe to see bodies lying on the ground covered with blankets surrounded by candles and a mysterious person in a robe walking between them.

Instructor Millie Laws later said: ""I guess from the outside view it could look like that [a mass murder], because they're all really still, very nice and relaxed.

Such was the concern over the escaped white tiger, play stopped at a cricket ground and animal specialists at nearby Marwell Zoo were prepared to send in a team with tranquiliser darts. But when the helicopter arrived and blew over the tiger, it became quickly clear  it was just a stuffed toy . The ""bone-chilling"" discovery was reported to police Earlier this year, a concerned member of the public called the police after finding what they thought was a pile of human bones in a bush in their Derbyshire garden.

Mr Shapps branded the wave of attacks - which Ukraine's military said comprised 158 missiles and drones targeting a number of cities simultaneously - ""murderous"". He suggested they were ""a desperate and futile attempt to regain momentum after the catastrophic loss of hundreds of thousands of conscripts and ahead of the humiliation of his three-day war entering a third calendar year."" The defence secretary said the package would restock UK-gifted air defence systems capable of striking down Russian drones and missiles with ""incredible accuracy"". The delivery is intended to protect civilians and infrastructure from drones and bombing. The Ministry of Defence (MoD) said the UK has now supplied a squadron of battle-ready Challenger 2 tanks, three batteries of self-propelled AS90 guns, hundreds of armoured and protected vehicles, as well as long-range precision strike capability in the form of Storm Shadow cruise missiles and long-range attack drones. But the announcement comes as questions are being asked about whether Western support for Ukraine is wavering after nearly three years of war there and a new conflict in the Middle East. The  latest tranche of US support was approved this week , but further packages will need fresh approval from Congress. There has also been disagreement among European countries about aid for Ukraine, with  Hungary blocking a £43bn (€50bn) EU aid package earlier this month . Mr Shapps added: ""Putin is testing Ukraine's defences and the West's resolve, hoping that he can clutch victory from the jaws of defeat. But he is wrong. ""Ukraine's degradation of the Russian Black Sea fleet has proven it is still in this fight to win. And today's air defence package sends an undeniable message, in the face of Russian barbarity that the UK remains absolutely committed to supporting Ukraine."" He called on the West ""to come together and redouble our efforts to get Ukraine what they need to win"". Earlier, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak posted on social media that the attacks showed  Russian President Vladimir Putin would ""stop at nothing to achieve his aim of eradicating freedom and democracy"". He said the UK would ""not let him win"" and called for the country to ""stand with Ukraine - for as long as it takes"".

It asks the court to order Israel to halt its attacks. Israel swiftly rejected the filing “with disgust.” South Africa has been a fierce critic of Israel’s military campaign.,"THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) — South Africa launched a case Friday at the United Nations’ top court accusing Israel of genocide against Palestinians in Gaza and asking the court to order Israel to halt its attacks. Israel swiftly rejected the filing “with disgust.” South Africa’s submission to the International Court of Justice alleges that “acts and omissions by Israel ... are genocidal in character” as they are committed with the intent “to destroy Palestinians in Gaza” as a part of the broader Palestinian national, racial and ethnic group. Advertisement It also asks the Hague-based court to issue an interim order for Israel to immediately suspend its military operations in Gaza. A hearing into that request is likely in the coming days or weeks. The case, if it goes ahead, will take years. Israel also accused South Africa of cooperating with Hamas, the militant group whose Oct. 7 cross-border attack in southern Israel triggered the ongoing war in Gaza. The statement also said Israel is committed to and operates according to international law and focuses its military actions solely against Hamas, adding that the residents of Gaza are not an enemy. Whether it will succeed in halting the war remains to be seen. In March 2022, the court ordered  Russia to halt hostilities  in Ukraine, a binding legal ruling that Moscow flouted as it pressed ahead with its devastating attacks on Ukrainian towns and cities. South Africa has been a fierce critic of Israel’s military campaign in Gaza. Many  including President Cyril Ramaphosa  have compared Israel’s policies in Gaza and the West Bank with South Africa’s past apartheid regime of racial segregation. Ramaphosa has accused Israel of war crimes and acts “tantamount to genocide.” Support HuffPost The Stakes Have Never Been Higher At HuffPost, we believe that everyone needs high-quality journalism, but we understand that not everyone can afford to pay for expensive news subscriptions.

South Australia Premier Peter Malinauskas expressed concern about the recent frequency of attacks in his state. “We’ve seen 11 fatal shark attacks in South Australia since the year 2000, so the fact we’ve seen three across this summer is startling and it is of concern,” he  told Australia’s Channel 9  on Friday.

The alert coincided with what Ukraine has called Russia's biggest day of air strikes since its war began.,"1 hour ago About sharing A missile believed to have been fired by Ukraine landed in Poland in November 2022, killing two people By Adam Easton BBC News, Warsaw Poland's armed forces chief believes a Russian missile entered Poland for almost three minutes and then turned back into Ukrainian airspace. Gen Wieslaw Kukula said the missile travelled about 40km (25 miles) into Polish airspace early on Friday. The alert coincided with what Ukraine has called Russia's biggest day of air strikes since its war began. President Andrzej Duda convened an emergency security meeting after the object was picked up on radar. Poland is a member of the Nato alliance, and Polish and Allied aircraft were scrambled in response to the incident at around 07:00 (06:00 GMT) on Friday. Operational Command spokesman Lt Col Jacek Goryszewski said an unidentified object had entered Poland from Ukraine near the town of Zamosc, in the Lublin region of south-eastern Poland, not far from the border. He told private broadcaster TVN24 the event may be linked with Russia's missile and drone attack against some of Ukraine's biggest cities. At least 30 people were killed in the attacks which targeted Lviv, the closest Ukrainian city to Lublin region, as well as Dnipro, Kyiv and other cities. Nato Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said  the alliance stood in solidarity with Poland  and ""remains vigilant"". An unconfirmed report said a search was taking place near the town of Hrubieszow. The Polish government has not ruled out Russian provocation. We should check both scenarios carefully,"" Deputy Defence Minister Stanislaw Wziatek told TVN24. Since Russia's invasion and war against Ukraine three missiles have entered Poland. In November 2022, two Polish farmers were killed by a missile that landed in the village of Przewodow near the Ukrainian border. In a harmless but more embarrassing incident from December last year, an object believed to have been an unarmed Russian Kh-55 cruise missile was fired from Belarus and crossed around 500km of Polish territory before landing in a forest. The object, which was detected by Polish air defences at the time, was only found in April this year by a passer-by not far from the city of Bydgoszcz in central Poland. Another unidentified object that entered Polish airspace this year from the direction of Belarus was probably an observation balloon. Radar contact with it was lost near Rypin in central Poland. Both sides of Poland's political arena have seized on the latest event to score points. His predecessor, Mariusz Blaszczak, from the right-wing Law and Justice-led government that lost power in an election in October and served as defence minister during the two earlier events, responded: ""We don't know what fell in the area of Tomaszow Lubelski.",2023-12-29 17:48:54,"[0.29521146163400735, 0.12488790613214037, 0.9221347619711745, 0.15131242094484945, 0.15500076081754166]",,Poland-says-Russian-missile-entered-airspace-then-went-into-Ukraine.wav

The ITC, a federal agency, ordered the halt in October to block Apple from using specific technologies underpinning a blood-oxygen measurement system in its Series 9 and Ultra 2 watches. Apple has been embroiled in an intellectual property dispute with the medical technology company Masimo over those technologies. The court’s action will allow sales of the two Apple Watch models pending its decision on whether to also permit sales as it weighs Apple’s appeal. The two watch models will be available at Apple’s online store by noon Pacific Time on Thursday, according to the company. They will return to some Apple stores Wednesday, with wider availability expected by Saturday. That dispute hasn’t directly affected Apple Watch sales yet because another regulatory body had ruled that AliveCor’s technology isn’t patentable. The legal tussle on that issue is still ongoing. The patent headaches facing Apple as it tries to infuse more medical technology into its watch models make it increasingly likely the company will either have to start working out licensing deals or simply acquiring startups specializing in the field, Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives predicted.

In a  complaint  filed Tuesday, officials argued that the company should be forced to offer reinstatement and back pay to Stephen Andrade, a nearly 18-year Trader Joe’s veteran in Massachusetts. Andrade lost his job making store signs in June after a manager accused him of leaving a power saw in the back of the store after being told to remove it. Advertisement Both Andrade and the union  previously told HuffPost  they believed his firing was retaliatory. The complaint says Trader Joe’s should have to send Andrade a letter “apologizing for any hardship or distress caused by his discharge.” In a phone interview, Andrade, 46, said he was pleased to see that prosecutors found merit in his story. “I hope that the union can keep chalking up some wins and we can hold the company accountable for their practices and trying to union-bust,” Andrade said. But I know that’s not how capitalism works these days.” The complaint also states that Trader Joe’s retaliated against union workers in Massachusetts and Minnesota by providing them with lesser 401(k) contributions than non-union workers. Officials say the move was intended to “discourage employees from engaging” in their protected rights. Trader Joe’s, which is based in Monrovia, California, did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Wednesday. Those earlier charges are all part of the new complaint that was issued Tuesday. Stephen Andrade, who worked nearly 18 years for Trader Joe's, was fired by the company in June.

Fighting along the front line is largely bogged down by winter weather after  Ukraine’s summer counteroffensive  failed to make a significant breakthrough along the roughly 1,000-kilometer (620-mile) line of contact.

Most crowded onto streets around the town’s main hospital, Al-Aqsa Martyrs, hoping it would be safer from Israeli strikes. Those areas continue to be hit by Israeli strikes that regularly crush homes full of people. Israel has said its campaign in Gaza is likely to last for months, vowing to dismantle Hamas across the territory and prevent a repeat of  its Oct. 7 attack  into southern Israel. Benny Gantz, a member of the country’s three-man War Cabinet, said the fighting ”will be expanded, according to need, to additional centers and additional fronts.” He and other Israeli officials also threatened greater military action against Lebanon’s Hezbollah, hiking fears of an all-out war on that front. Israeli Foreign Minister Eli Cohen warned Wednesday that “all options are on the table” if Hezbollah does not withdraw from the border area, as called for under a 2006 U.N. cease-fire. Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah “must understand that he’s next,” Cohen said. More than 21,100 Palestinians , most of them women and children, have been killed, according to the Health Ministry in Hamas-ruled Gaza.

We haven’t seen such bombing since the start of the war,” said Rami Abu Mosab, speaking from Bureij, where he has sheltered since fleeing his home in northern Gaza. Most civilians are taking refuge here from Bureij camp with their belongings following an evacuation order, as battles are ongoing between Israel and the Palestinian militant group Hamas. This was the third move further south for Ibrahim al-Zatari, a daily laborer. On Wednesday morning, they made an hourslong journey on foot to Deir al-Balah, where — like many others — they wandered the streets looking for an empty spot to lie down. “Where should we go?” With much of northern Gaza leveled, Palestinians fear a similar fate awaits other areas, including Khan Younis, where Israeli forces launched ground operations in early December. Health Ministry spokesman Ashraf al-Qidra said at least 20 people were killed and dozens more wounded. Before troops move in, heavy bombardment targets what Israel says is Hamas’ tunnels and military infrastructure. Israel has said Hamas must be destroyed after its  its Oct. 7 attack  in which militants broke through Israel’s formidable defenses and killed some 1,200 people — mostly civilians — and abducted around 240.

Three men, aged 48, 59 and 69, were killed after a boat with 11 people on board capsized in rough weather in Moreton Bay off the south Queensland coast on Tuesday, police said. Ambulances took eight survivors to a hospital in stable conditions. Queensland Police Acting Chief Superintendent Andrew Pilotto said those rescued were lucky to survive. “The storm was still raging when they were rescued,"" Pilotto said. ""It would have been very difficult to survive in those conditions anywhere.” Elsewhere, a 59-year-old woman was killed by a falling tree in the Queensland city of Gold Coast on Monday night. The body of a 9-year-old girl was found on Tuesday in the neighboring city of Brisbane hours after she disappeared in a flooded stormwater drain. They were among three women swept into the flooded river through a stormwater drain on Tuesday. Queensland Police Commissioner Katarina Carroll blamed “extraordinarily difficult weather” for the tragedies. “It has been a very tragic 24 hours due to the weather,” Carroll told reporters. Severe weather has lashed parts of southeast Australia since Monday including Queensland and Victoria. A woman, who is yet to be identified, was found dead late Tuesday after flash flooding receded at a campground in Buchan in regional Victoria. Also on Tuesday, a 44-year-old man was killed by a falling branch on his rural property in Caringal in eastern Victoria.

The statement arrives less than two weeks after Ye went on an antisemitic rant in Las Vegas. He also once suggested slavery was a choice and called the coronavirus vaccine “the mark of the beast.,"The  rapper formerly known as Kanye West,  who has a long history of making antisemitic comments, apologized to the Jewish community in an Instagram post written in Hebrew on Tuesday. “I sincerely apologize to the Jewish community for any unintended outburst caused by my words or actions,” Ye wrote. Advertisement “It was not my intention to offend or demean, and I deeply regret any pain I may have caused,” continued the rapper, who  legally changed his name to Ye in 2021. The statement arrives less than two weeks after Ye went on an antisemitic rant in Las Vegas while promoting his upcoming album “Vultures,” due out Jan. 12. “After causing untold damage by using his vast influence and platform to poison countless minds with vicious antisemitism and hate, an apology in Hebrew may be the first step on a long journey towards making amends to the Jewish community and all those who he has hurt,” the Anti-Defamation League said in a statement to The Associated Press and other news outlets on Tuesday. “Ultimately, actions will speak louder than words but this initial act of contrition is welcome.” The American Jewish Committee, however, criticized Ye’s use of Hebrew in the apology. “To be sure, using Hebrew to communicate with the Jewish community intentionally denies most American Jews— and, consequently, non-Jews—the ability to directly see Kanye’s apology.” Advertisement “While he claims that he is committed to learning and greater understanding, this apology speaks to ‘any pain I may have caused,’ rather than acknowledging the pain that he has caused,” the AJC continued. He also once suggested slavery was a choice and called the coronavirus vaccine “the mark of the beast.” In October 2022, he was criticized for wearing a “White Lives Matter” T-shirt at  his Paris Fashion Week show  and tweeted that he was going to go “death con 3 on JEWISH PEOPLE,” an apparent reference to the U.S. defense readiness condition scale, DEFCON. Later that month, the  Balenciaga fashion house cut ties  with Ye and he  lost the lucrative partnership with Adidas  that helped catapult him to billionaire status over his remarks. Adidas has sold hundreds of millions of euros  in remaining Yeezy shoes,  donating part of the profits to groups like the Anti-Defamation League and the Philonise & Keeta Floyd Institute for Social Change. (Recently, though,  Adidas CEO Bjørn Gulden said on a podcast episode  that he didn’t think Ye “meant what he said and I don’t think he’s a bad person.” Gulden  later apologized,  the Anti-Defamation League said.) He was  locked out of his accounts on Instagram and what was then known as Twitter,  though he has since returned to both platforms. But less than two months later, he told  conspiracy theorist and host Alex Jones  that he sees “good things about Hitler.” “We’ve seen this behavior from Kanye before — the antisemitic rant and the follow-up apology,” the American Jewish Committee said. Ye’s latest apology ends with him saying he’s committed to “learning from this experience” and plans on “making amends.” A representative for Ye did not immediately respond to the AP’s request for further comment.

Literally Media, which owns Know Your Meme, Cracked and other brands, acquired Mel for an undisclosed amount. Originally a content site for the Dollar Shave Club, Mel was once  “the rare men’s magazine.”","Men are so back: Mel magazine, an audacious digital media site for the guys, will get a new lease on life next year after its unceremonious dissolution in 2022. Literally Media, which owns Know Your Meme, Cracked and other brands, announced Friday that it acquired Mel magazine for an undisclosed amount. Originally a content site for the Dollar Shave Club, Mel was  once  “the rare men’s magazine that has taken upon itself to investigate masculinity, not enforce it.” Advertisement Oren Katzeff, CEO of Literally Media, told HuffPost that he wanted to acquire Mel for its unique voice and a loyal audience. When you make an acquisition like this, you have to be very respectful of that while also thinking about how to expand and grow the voice into the next chapter of the brand.” Mel doesn’t have an editor-in-chief or any writers yet, but the magazine will start publishing next year. Katzeff said he would like to have three to five people on staff with a mix of full-time and freelance employees and then “grow from there.” Katzeff said he plans to package Mel “with opportunities beyond the articles on site,” which will include a newsletter strategy as well as introducing video, which will open “more doors” to brand deals. Advertisement “There’s really a ripe opportunity for Mel to expand beyond just the website into at the very least video and possibly audio as well,” Katzeff said. “Literally Media as a company years ago was probably doing anywhere from 10 to 15 million video views a month, and now we’re doing in the hundreds of millions. So I’m pretty bullish in terms of Mel’s opportunity in both the video and audio space moving forward.” Mel magazine’s stories included headlines like  “Our Eternal Horniness for the Camp Counselor”  and  “I Tried Mark Wahlberg’s Catholic App to See If It Could Reconnect Me With God.”  Mel magazine reached 4 million unique monthly visitors during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, according to a news release, but in  March 2021, it ceased publication . A few months later, Recurrent Ventures acquired it only to pull the plug in 2022  and lay off all staff members . Mel magazine is the most recent digital media outlet Paste magazine acquired Jezebel , the women’s publication, after it shuttered in November. Katzeff said it’s “more challenging that ever” to run a successful media company. “I think we’ll be seeing more opportunities like these, I think we’ll be seeing more collaborations moving forward,” he said. “And, you know, what I hope with an acquisition like this is that we can also leverage some of the success we’ve had with our other brands to help revive some of the audience on Mel. “I think the power of a network is something that you get to enjoy that you don’t necessarily get as an independent entity. And so, my guess would be as we go into 2024, if the market conditions continue as they are, which is, again, greater challenges in terms of audience, greater challenges in terms of monetization, I think we may see more and more opportunities like these.” Advertisement Support HuffPost The Stakes Have Never Been Higher At HuffPost, we believe that everyone needs high-quality journalism, but we understand that not everyone can afford to pay for expensive news subscriptions.

In an exchange about holiday plans with colleague Alexa Maslowski, Bruck said: “The extent of my traveling is probably going to visit my girlfriend in Cleveland and that’s about it.” Advertisement “Girlfriend” carried heavy freight for the multimedia journalist. “I said “girlfriend” on air for the first time today, which some people may say “ok, who cares?” … but to me it’s a step toward accepting and loving myself fully and being authentic on and off the air,” she wrote alongside the clip on Instagram last month. Bruck  told People  on Monday that her decision was “spur of the moment” and it’s had lasting consequences. “Messages are pouring in from all around the world, including Ghana, Germany, Australia, London, as well as many states across the U.S.,” Bruck said. “People are telling me how much this visibility means to them and that they’re so proud of me.” Advertisement Bruck said she has been open about her sexuality on social media but an on-air acknowledgment was the icing on the cake. “When I finally said it out loud, I smiled inside because it was a big moment for me,” she said to People. Bruck might have undersold her holiday plans, though. It looks like she and girlfriend Lauren Lanzaretta are doing up the season in epic fashion.

Project Veritas did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Project Veritas is known for its heavily edited videos, like a video targeting  Planned Parenthood  in 2008, where O’Keefe and Lila Rose, the founder of an anti-abortion group,  illegally recorded Planned Parenthood employees consulting Rose, who they believed to be a 13-year-old pregnant girl . Giles and O’Keefe worked together in 2009 on a hidden-video “sting” that purportedly showed employees of the progressive  Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now  (ACORN) agreeing to aid the pair in crimes. The two, who had been employed by conservative journalist Andrew Breitbart, ended up paying settlements to one of the ACORN staffers. The organization, however, lost much of its funding despite investigations that found no wrongdoing.

Shows like ""Game of Thrones"" and ""Succession"" are measured in their success by how much buzz they generate online. People enjoy checking in with characters in whom they’ve invested time, he says.","Buffy’s bit of banter has been  referenced by other shows  as well, including “Supernatural” and “The Flash.” Advertisement The moment is more than just a wink-and-a-nudge to the show’s time slot, concocted in a boardroom by a bunch of executives. It was a very real ode to the time fans carved out every week, choosing to spend it with Buffy, rather than with other characters jostling for their attention. Watching her story unfold was an intentional journey, like a great, long friendship. If your favorite show releases on Tuesday evenings on Netflix or Max but you can’t catch it, you can simply watch it the next day — or more likely, months later,  when all the episodes are available  and you can lie down and consume them all in one go. In this sense, binge-watching has turned the temporality of TV on its head: Those of us who grew up prior to the streaming era would conform our schedules around television shows, now television shows are available to us when our schedule permits. Sure, you can have a community when something drops — but that level of camaraderie and community is no longer a formal part of the television viewing experience. Bingeing, much like the type of eating it describes, is often something done in solitude, cut off from others. Alamy With such a model, what gets lost is that episodic weekly television often created deep bonds with characters that felt much more real to us. When I was getting ready to end my school year, I knew there was a world-ending battle coming that would put a neat pin on her year, just as my final report card would do for me. But often these limited series don’t exactly say how much time has passed; characters can seemingly age years while, in the span of the show, it’s only been a few days or weeks. There was a routine and familiarity with the way time passed on network TV that feels quaint compared to the way shows are experienced now. This paradigm shift reminds me of a viral Slate article, which consisted of people simply sharing how they used to  spend their evenings  after work. While shows like “Game of Thrones” and “Succession” are measured in their success by how much buzz they generate online, the lesson of their weekly success, whether you measure it in buzz, ratings, or something else, should be that people enjoy checking in with characters in whom they’ve invested time, both hours on a Sunday night and weeks on a calendar. It’s what transforms them from characters that live on screen to characters that live on in our hearts and our minds.

Fake shipping notifications are the top issue, followed by fraudulent products bought online. To avoid losing money, do a gut check with yourself about those deals you spot on the internet.","In a new AARP  survey  of 1,880 U.S. holiday shoppers, 80% of respondents said they’ve encountered holiday fraud, with fake shipping notifications being the top issue (53%), followed by fraudulent products bought through an online ad (38%). But often, you may not know the charity was a scam until it’s too late. Advertisement “A lot of times with charity frauds, victims don’t know that they’re actually a victim,” said Amy Nofziger, the director of victim support for the AARP Fraud Watch Network. “Any good, legitimate charity will take your money today, tomorrow, or the next day,” Nofziger said. “But of course, you either don’t receive the goods and now your payment information is exfiltrated.” To avoid losing money, do a gut check with yourself about those deals you spot on the internet. Nofziger said it’s a red flag if the seller has every size and color available when any other website is sold out of that item. If it’s a seller on Facebook Marketplace, avoid listings that  only list peer-to-peer payment systems  like Venmo, CashApp or Zelle as an option because scammers prefer these untraceable and unretractable forms of payment. Advertisement That’s because scammers are known to tamper with gift cards on display racks and set it up so that  when you register to activate them, the scammer will be notified  and they can spend or transfer the funds before you or your gift recipient can use it. Some scammers impersonate airline customer service agents to get your personal and banking information. Because imposters often make fraudulent airline websites, Nofziger said you should also be wary of clicking airfare links you found via a search engine result and instead should go directly to the airline’s website. And actually, I can offer you a $50 discount if you can get me an Amex [American Express] gift card because we’re running a special with Amex,” Nofziger said as an example. “We’re seeing the injection of malware on merchant checkout pages,” Jabbara said. It also helps to check the seller’s reviews and see if they have had a large number of disputes and chargebacks in the past because that’s a red flag, Jabbara said. “You might get a text message from FedEx or USPS saying that they weren’t able to deliver a package because there was missing information on your account: ‘Just click here to fill the information out, your package will be coming,’” Nofziger said as an example. Beyond avoiding suspiciously misspelled text messages, keep track of what you’re buying to know who delivers your package and when. 10'000 Hours via Getty Images Shipping scams can be incredibly common during the holidays. Your options are more limited if it is with cash or not on a card. “If you’re using a peer-to-peer app or using cash or wire transfer or some of non-card payment method, your recourse is somewhat more limited and undefined,” Jabbara said, noting that whether you get money back will depend on the service’s specific policies, and sometimes “it’s kind of a ‘you’re on your own approach.’” Report the scam to authorities.

Setting clear limits for different holiday spending areas will help you avoid making impulse purchases. Emotional spending can be a big problem around the Holiday season, which tends to bring up childhood memories and a sense of pressure.","The holidays are an exciting time for parties, sweet treats, shiny decor and family gatherings. “Maintaining financial boundaries during the holiday season is crucial for several reasons.” Advertisement Stevens emphasized that it’s important to resist the temptation to overspend so you can avoid accumulating debt, foster healthy relationships, minimize stress and model financial responsibility. “I think it’s important to decide on a holiday budget well in advance of the holiday season ― this can include travel, food and gifting expenses,” said Samantha Gorelick, managing financial planner at  Brunch & Budget . “Some folks save all year long for the holiday season, but if you didn’t prepare that far in advance, decide now on an amount you will spend and try your best to stick with it.” Advertisement Setting clear limits for different holiday spending areas will help you avoid making impulse purchases. Doing so can cause you to derail your long-term savings goals.” Make a list (and check it twice). “Put the amount you are willing to spend next to each item and/or person before you start shopping, and please, please update it in with your actual spending as you go,” said Anne Lester, a retirement savings expert and author of the upcoming book  “Your Best Financial Life.” She emphasized how easy it is to spend beyond your means, particularly in this era of apps and browser extensions that effectively gamify the process of purchasing expensive items and experiences. Advertisement “It’s important to set realistic and effective boundaries that will make you consider if the thing you are about to get for yourself or someone on your list is really something that is needed ― or even truly wanted,” Lester said. “With high rates of inflation, don’t feel shame if your holiday season might look different than years past,” Howard said. “There might be less gifts under the tree, but maybe they’re more meaningful this year ― like a coupon book for your significant other or spending time with your family on a service project. We should all extend a little more grace this holiday season when it comes to spending.” Start new traditions. But the internet and social media have made it all too easy to fall into that trap. “I think one of the reasons that it becomes easy to violate or ignore financial boundaries is because of the value we’ve been taught spending and overspending on gifts means, as it relates to showing care and showing love,” Stevens said. “In other words, we’ve been taught by the media and our peers that spending equals love, when that’s not necessarily true.” Take the time to consider the beliefs and values you developed growing up, and whether you want to carry them into your holiday spending as an adult. Additionally, each of my kids will receive up to three gifts and one of the gifts will be something that can be used on vacation.” Advertisement Avoid emotional spending. “When it comes to setting financial boundaries this holiday season, be hyper-aware of emotional triggers, social pressure, [fear of missing out] and today’s gift-giving culture,” Howard said. “If you are overspending, explore where you learned this behavior and dig for the root issue behind the spending.” Emotional spending can be a big problem around the holiday season, which tends to bring up childhood memories and a sense of pressure to achieve Hallmark-style “perfection.” “If you feel a rush from shopping, understand your purpose of spending,” Howard said. “Protecting yourself from yourself might look like knowing exactly what gifts you’re buying for others, or only shopping online to reduce extra purchases in store.” Prepare to save after the holidays. So, after the holidays, make a conscious effort to spend less than usual for a couple of months to make up for any overspending during the holidays.” Advertisement Think about your future self. “Think about the dreams you are working towards and how the decision of saving that money today instead will help you get there faster, instead of spending it on a portable monitor or a spin scrubber on TikTok Shop, no matter how many coupons they give you!” she said. “I can’t emphasize enough how important it is to think about taking good care of your future self as well as your current self.” Do you have info to share with HuffPost reporters?",2023-11-28 10:45:01,"[0.1646988401718998, 0.4718313266687102, 0.13149990399152403, 0.11281746886177595, 0.8486633520954692]",,The-1-Thing-You-Need-To-Do-Before-You-Start-Holiday-Shopping-This-Year.wav

Sales create a sense of urgency with buzzy terms like “one day only,” “limited time, “daily deal” and “flash sale” Avoid sale alerts or bricks-and-mortar stores that tempt your spaving impulses.","But other practices are more sneakily harmful ― like “spaving.” “Spaving is the act of spending money to save money,”  Andrea Woroch , a consumer finance and budgeting expert, told HuffPost. “The problem with spaving is that it can trick you into spending more in order to receive a certain savings benefit in return,” said Jacqueline Howard, the head of money wellness at Ally Bank. “Because of the incentive, it’s easy to feel better about adding a few more items to your cart, even if you weren’t planning on making those additional purchases,” Howard explained. Woroch noted that sales create a sense of urgency with buzzy terms like “one day only,” “limited time, “daily deal” and “flash sale” ― making customers feel like they’ll waste a rare opportunity if they don’t pounce. “The reality is, retailers are constantly rolling out new sales, so just because you miss out on a sale today doesn’t mean you can’t get the same item on sale later,” she explained. Many people also feel a sort of high when they score a good deal on an item, regardless of how much they wanted or needed it in the first place. “Even if you get something at a really good sale price, you’re still spending money that could be going towards something more important, like building your savings, paying down debt, investing, etc.,” Woroch said. “A few bucks here and there adds up and can put a huge dent in your overall budget.” Then there’s the fact that sale items often come with limited or nonexistent return policies. Advertisement For some people, spaving leads to credit card debt, which can mean paying interest that far exceeds whatever was saved in the sales deal. Remove the temptation to spave by avoiding sale alerts however possible. “Create a list before you go shopping and stick to it,” Howard suggested. Plus, you can look around your home or closet to see if you already have something like it — because if you do, even another $10 is unnecessary to spend.” She recommended implementing a 24-hour waiting period to confirm that you don’t have the item or something similar, as well as to shop around, compare prices or even look for a refurbished option. Ask yourself, how will you feel about this purchase in three, six or nine months from now?” Westend61 via Getty Images Try to avoid sale alerts or bricks-and-mortar stores that tempt your spaving impulses. “Stay out of stores that have too many deal temptations,” Woroch said. And be on alert whenever you have to shop in person. “Use browser tools that do the deal hunting for you so you don’t get tempted by another sale when looking for a relevant coupon.” She recommended  PriceBlink , which runs an instant price comparison when you’re looking at a product online and presents other sites that are selling the same item for less, as well as  Sidekick  from  CouponCabin . “The time it takes you to fetch your credit card, the urge to buy should pass, helping you avoid an unnecessary purchase.” Advertisement Do a spending audit. “It’s also a good idea to take a look at just how much you’ve spent over the year so far on excess purchases, which can be eye-opening and give you a little fuel to make changes.” She also recommended thinking about the emotions driving your impulse spaving purchases. “Every time you’re tempted to spave, just think about how that money can go towards helping you reach your goal faster.” Advertisement Stop comparing yourself with others. “When we compare our experiences to that of others, we often lose sight of our values and overspend.” You’ve likely heard the expression “keeping up with the Joneses,” which speaks to the social pressure that many people feel to buy things.",2023-11-09 10:45:00,"[0.19030965155115348, 0.12945528402531137, 0.10357154255142573, 0.078551935497706, 0.9644304510785042]",,Are-You-Guilty-Of-‘Spaving’?-Here’s-How-To-Spot-The-Toxic-Spending-Habit.wav

You misunderstand the difference between a springing power or one that goes into immediate effect. A power of attorney document may require witnesses or notarization for validity.","“A power of attorney enables you to proactively plan for unexpected events, such as illness, injury or cognitive decline, which might render you incapable of managing your own affairs,” said David Watson, an estate planning attorney based in Mequon, Wisconsin. Beyond the mistake of not having one to begin with, HuffPost asked estate lawyers about the worst mistakes they commonly see people do with powers of attorney that they want you to avoid. You only get one POA for your health care or finances, but not both types. You misunderstand the difference between a springing power or one that goes into immediate effect. “Health care powers of attorney typically ‘spring’ into action only when the principal becomes incapacitated. Choi said that in the cases of younger people in their 30s and 40s, she would typically recommend a springing power where it “will become effective only when your doctor says, ‘Oh, OK, she doesn’t have capacity to make these decisions.’ And by attaching that letter to the power of attorney, it becomes effective.”  Meanwhile for elderly people who just need help paying bills and accounts online, a springing power of attorney could be “another hurdle” because “the doctors can’t maybe say you’re incapacitated, because you have capacity,” Choi said. Carmen Rosas, an estate planning attorney based in San Mateo, California, said people can approach their power of attorney document with a “set it and forget it” mentality out of discomfort. But this is a legal document you want to review regularly, because it can give your agent a lot of control that you may no longer want to grant if that person is now your ex or estranged child. ‘My child is not like that.’ But you know, if that’s the case, then I wouldn’t have a job.” “If your spouse is getting elderly, has trouble managing money, or any other issues, they may not be a good candidate to make any decisions for you,” Walny said. Depending on your state’s laws, a power of attorney document may require witnesses or notarization for validity. “Overlooking these essential requirements can render the document null and void,” Watson said. “When you make a committee, that often leads to confusion, delay, mistakes and other issues. “You can say things like, ‘Well, they’re able to sell [property] but not until my youngest child reaches the age of 25,’” Rosas said. If you want Medicaid planning, that better be in the document,” Walny said. “If you want broad or narrow gifting powers, that better be in the document. If you want your agent to be able to access intangible assets like your voicemails, online photos or emails, that better be in the document.” Ultimately, creating a power of attorney document will take careful research and potentially awkward conversations, but it’s worth it for the emotional, legal and financial costs you could be sparing yourself and your loved ones. “Let’s say I’m incapacitated right now today, and my husband doesn’t have power of attorney,” Choi said as an example.

For Lopez, working alone helps her efficiently gather insights and data before she has to be in a team setting. Lopez said that managers can also misconstrue Gen Z colleagues not showing up to the office as a lack of team spirit. Gen Zers might prefer doing things solo because they work in a judgmental environment.","“But other than that, if I can do it by myself, I will 99% of the time just prefer to do things by myself.” Advertisement For Lopez, working alone helps her efficiently gather insights and data before she has to be in a team setting, and allows her to finish work on time. I honestly prefer to preserve my energy and over-communicate when it’s drastically needed.” Why Gen Z Prefers More Solo Work At work, Gen Zers’ independence can sometimes create the negative reputation that they are disengaged from the rest of their team. When asked, Gen Z workers said that there is more nuance in why they might want to work alone than these generalized findings suggest. But at the same time, he appreciates when there are colleagues around, too. He said Gen Zers might prefer doing things solo because they work in a judgmental environment. They might be in a workplace where they cannot listen to music uninterrupted, or where eating a snack during a meeting could cause colleagues to think, “Oh, is this really the time to be eating?” With other colleagues present, “you kind of have that magnifying glass on you,” he said. Lopez said that managers can also misconstrue Gen Z colleagues not showing up to the office as a lack of team spirit. What Gen Z And Older Generations Can Learn From Each Other Fernandez said that there should be flexibility for remote work and working alone, but said it can also be helpful for Gen Z professionals to know that “you cannot be efficient with people. As logical as we are, we are emotional beings.” Advertisement Even though it can be inefficient, physically showing up at work can increase relationship-building, and it’s “where you learn to manage dysfunctional teammates, where you learn to negotiate or, frankly, even influence others about your idea,” she said. Guevara said that when he advises Gen Z friends who work remotely and alone, he asks them to separate the situations where it’s comfortable to work alone versus where it’s necessary. “If you need music to work, that’s one thing,” he said. In a 2022 Gallup  poll , Gen Z was the demographic most ambivalent and disengaged with the workplace, but it was not because young workers were slacking off and not caring about their jobs. Most reported missing a close connection to their colleagues, manager or employer. When Fernandez teaches university students, she said that she asks for class volunteers to be her internal focus group, so they can tell her what’s working and what’s not in the classroom. “[Gen Z is] going to be the next set of managers,” Fernandez said. “There’s that preconceived notion that ‘Gen Z is lazy, Gen Z doesn’t like working with other people’ that they’ll use to influence how they approach a situation with someone who happens to be Gen Z.” Advertisement Guevara said that he has Gen Z friends who “get talked down to” by others at work, “as if they don’t know what they’re talking about.” “The way that they talk to people is obviously going to have an impact, especially when there’s a huge age difference,” he said.

If you’ve ever felt like screaming into a pillow or lying on your couch after a hard day at work, you might be feeling something known as “ post-work restraint collapse.","And every year, there’s new language to articulate those long-held but often buried feelings. The Lazy Girl Job This year marked a turning point for how younger professionals are setting their work expectations. Instead, there was the rise of “lazy girl jobs.” In a May  TikTok video , Gabrielle Judge ― a content creator who popularized the term ― defined “lazy girl jobs” as positions where you can have “pretty comfortable salaries, and not do that much work and be remote.”   @gabrielle_judge   Career advice for women who don’t know what remote job to apply to. Women are here to collect those pay checks and move on from the work day. #corporatejobs   #jobsearchhacks   #remoteworking   #antihustleculture   #9to5     ♬ original sound - Anti Work Girlboss     As Judge previously  told  HuffPost: “A ‘lazy girl job’ mindset is all about creating as much freedom and space in your personal life as possible through efficient work days, although not everyone will understand.” Advertisement The LGJ’s wide appeal on TikTok speaks to how professionals are redefining success. Voluntelling If you’ve been quote-unquote “volunteered” for an assignment you didn’t ask for, you’ve actually been “voluntold.” It’s a phrase that was  popularized  by the U.S. military to describe situations where somebody is volunteered for a task without getting the opportunity to say “no,” and with implicit pressure to say “yes.” At work, these assignments may not sound exactly like marching orders, but deep down, you know they are. Advertisement A term like “‘hey’ hanging” perfectly describes the anxiety co-workers may be causing with their messages. Advertisement This summer, more tech employees  complained  that they received these “reassignment” orders from employers. “I don’t see it as ever being a good thing for an employee,” Rahbar warned. “If it were to happen to me, the first thing I would do is probably start my job search immediately for something that did suit my skills where I would be a better fit.” 6. Body Doubling If you work best with an accountability buddy, try a work exercise known as “ body doubling .” With this technique, commonly used by professionals with ADHD, you do a task and have another person on Zoom or in person doing a task too. You might already be doing body doubling without knowing it has a name. It can mean working quietly with a friend in a coffee shop, or it can mean having them finish the same task as you at the same time. Either way, try out this hack if you have trouble concentrating or finishing tasks. Post-Work Restraint Collapse If you’ve ever felt like screaming into a pillow or lying on your couch after a hard day at work, you might be feeling something known as “ post-work restraint collapse .” It’s a concept that therapists are using to describe the bone-deep exhaustion caused by draining work days. Post-work restraint collapse can look like “a sense of depletion and having nothing left for other activities, even things that you might really enjoy, like exercise, spending time with your family or other social activities,”  Emily Treichler , a licensed clinical psychologist, previously told HuffPost about post-work restraint collapse.

According to Connaghan’s 2023  survey  of 380 people who have been Santas, Santa is, on average, 66 years old and most likely to grow his own beard for the job. “You represent something magical, something of a spirit almost where people like to say, ‘Wow,’” said Adrian Walker, who is a Santa based in the Atlanta metro area. “I always tell people, it’s not about believing in Santa as much as it is believing in the possibility of joy and love and just humanity ― just the good that exists.” HuffPost talked with four Santas about the secrets of their profession, from their biggest tips to what keeps them coming back year after year:  Advertisement 1. If we can make a child believe one more year, the parents are so happy. Some do get paid a lot — but there are upfront costs too.

For example, Sinclair is the president of a group on  Facebook  called  Santas of Color Coalition  and he said they offer monthly Zoom trainings on topics like beard maintenance, how to be a storyteller and how to be on social media. Connaghan said the most common challenging question children will ask him is “Can you fix it? Can you get Mom and Dad back together?”  Connaghan said in these situations, he acknowledges what the child is saying but does not make promises about whether he can fix anything.

This guidance applies to both checked and carry-on luggage. Craft scissors are only permitted in checked luggage. Snow globes are considered liquids and will be confiscated by TSA agents.,"Flying during the holidays can come with logistical challenges, especially when gifts are involved. Others might be concerned about packing them securely to avoid damage or other mishaps. But is it OK to fly with wrapped presents? We asked a couple of travel experts to share their advice. What To Know About Taking Wrapped Gifts On Flights “Be sure to follow  TSA guidelines  when packing,” said Cheryl Nelson ,  a travel preparedness expert and founder of  Prepare with Cher . “While there aren’t specific gift wrapping restrictions, there is a chance your perfectly wrapped present with the curled bow could be unwrapped by a TSA agent if your luggage is flagged for safety inspection.” Although there aren’t explicit rules that forbid it, TSA advises against wrapping your gifts before packing them in your suitcase since there’s a chance this could get undone in the security screening process. This guidance applies to both checked and carry-on luggage. “Whether a wrapped gift is in a carry-on bag or checked luggage, if your luggage is flagged at TSA, your gift will be unwrapped,” Nelson said. “This could cause delays for you getting through TSA security and delay your checked luggage from making it on time for your scheduled flight departure.” Advertisement What To Do Instead Understandably, you might not want to risk getting delayed or having your beautiful wrapping paper get torn up. But there are ways to be prepared without having everything fully gift-wrapped. “You can keep your gifts in a gift bag or a box, but you’ll want to make sure that they can be easily opened by TSA agents if they need to be inspected,” said Lindsay Schwimer, a consumer travel expert with the trip-booking app  Hopper . Nelson offered some other suggestions for flying with presents as well. Advertisement Other Things To Keep In Mind As you prepare for your holiday flights, remember that everything you pack in your bag is subject to TSA regulations, including gifts. So if you got someone a set of nice hand lotions, make sure they’re carry-on size or put them in your checked bag. “Travelers who are unsure if an item should be packed in a carry-on or checked bag should check the TSA homepage and reference the ‘ What can I bring? Nelson noted that craft scissors are only permitted in checked luggage, so don’t try to toss them in your carry-on with other gift-wrapping supplies. “Chances are that someone at your destination will likely have scissors you can borrow,” she added. “If you plan to pack a festive snow globe in your carry-on luggage, remember that snow globes are considered liquids and anything liquid larger than 3.4 ounces ― roughly the size of a tennis ball ― will be flagged and confiscated by TSA agents,” she said. “If you plan to gift a snow globe, please carefully wrap it in bubble wrap for protection in your checked luggage.” And remember: If you are flying this holiday season, be sure to take all the  proper precautions  to help reduce the spread of COVID-19.

To help you plan a non-gambling focused Vegas vacation, I’ve compiled some favorite restaurants, attractions and more highlights from Sin City. Where To Stay The hotel options in Las Vegas feel infinite. Advertisement Caroline Bologna/HuffPost From left: Bellagio Conservatory & Botanical Gardens, a room view and Chihuly glass ceiling. Another highlight of this hotel is the  food hall , which boasts culinary delights like Tekka Bar handrolls, Lardo sandwiches, and a unique take on street meat from David Chang at Bāng Bar by Momofuku. If you’re looking to really splash out, the Wynn and Encore are many Vegas fans’ go-to spots for luxury ― there’s even a golf course on site. Peppermill Restaurant and Fireside Lounge  is an iconic diner that’s been around for more than 50 years. I also tried Martha Stewart’s restaurant,  The Bedford , which transports you to her New York farmhouse, and I got a taste of NYC with brunch at  Sadelle’s . For more casual sports bar vibes, I’ve also had a nice time at  Flanker , which serves elevated game day food.

Many  ballroom, latin and heels (a dance style performed while wearing high-heeled shoes — think Beyoncé’s  “Single Ladies” ) dancers  perform complicated, physically intense dance routines while wearing heels (even stilettos). So, if dance heels can give dancers the comfort and support they need to practice and perform, can’t the everyday heels-wearer also benefit from them? Depending on the shape of your foot though, that may be true. “Some women have feet that are narrower [in the front] and it’s easier for them to wear high heels. Although regular heels’ function is primarily aesthetic, dance heels are designed to look good and Repetto ,  Capezio ,  Vamp,   Aida Dance ,  Very Fine ,  Burju  and  Vivaz.

I’d say we had our shoes on for about five hours. Whether or not you want to invest in dance heels boils down to your aesthetic, desired comfort level and how well your feet can tolerate heels. But certainly, it’s going to be more comfortable than wearing your traditional stiletto.” My hopes were high. Unfortunately, my feet still were throbbing after a night on the dance floor.

We asked a fashion stylist, a fashion editor, and fashion designer what trends they would never wear. ""Copy cats happen because there’s no copyright protecting fashion,” said Beverly Osemwenkhae.","Part of the trend cycle is understanding that what was once ugly is suddenly considered posh, and vice versa, because all aesthetics are not only subjective, but also related to zeitgeist. Advertisement Haute couture has always dipped a toe into what we might consider “ugly fashion,” because accessibility and wearability aren’t the primary concerns here. Around 2014 with the popularization of  Normcore , “ugly fashion” became more mainstream, and a way for people to rebel against beauty standards without spending thousands of dollars on a Balenciaga coat. Having said all that, there are many of us who don’t want to look ugly on purpose, but rather dress to capture an aesthetic that reads as polished, put together and also woke. We’ll avoid calling this aesthetic “stylish,” for as noted above looking ugly can be considered  en vogue . And we’ll also avoid talking about this aesthetic as “flattering,” because that term is not only subjective but has come to be a euphemism for “slimming.”  Instead, let’s call these trends “not wearable.” Ahead, we asked a fashion stylist, a fashion editor, and fashion designer what trends they would never wear — and yes, while aesthetics were highly considered, they weren’t the only reasons our style experts noted for not wearing a trend. Flip Flop Heels Beverly Osemwenkhae , a fashion stylist in New York and London, noted the shoe choice doesn’t “look comfortable,” and that it defies a put-together look. Not because I don’t think they’re cool but because I feel that there is an imminent expiration date.” She called the look passé (and not in a nostalgic way.) “They’ve garnered attention with everything else Y2K, like low-rise, cropped tops, and racer-style leather jackets. They’re not very versatile, which will likely be a collective turn-off as minimalist, capsule-like wardrobes become more popular. Another Y2K turn-off is the denim silhouette that  rose to popularity in 2000  after being worn by stars like Jennifer Lopez and Britney Spears, which Osemwenkhae called incredibly “dated.” She added it is a “Y2k trend that belongs in the past.”  4.

Girth enhancement, or the injection of hyaluronic acid into the penis for a fuller look, is a booming enterprise.","Still, recent data indicates an uptick in elective cosmetic procedures for men. Nonetheless, we had a look at what types of procedures are most popular with men and why they’re pursuing them now. (The same Google Trends tool was referenced in studies about plastic surgery pre- and post-COVID, and is considered an effective way to “determine a relationship between public interest in plastic surgery after the celebrity popularization of specific procedures,” according to the aforementioned study.) “ At Lushful Aesthetics more than 95% of our patients are men, so we truly get to see these trends unfold,” he said. “Men contributed to this high water mark, however, in the same relative proportion as they have historically.” Ahead, we break down three of the most popular elective male plastic surgery trends of 2023, and experts offer explanations for why these procedures are on our cultural radar.

Volanthevist via Getty Images ""Jawline enhancement is easily the most popular facial aesthetic procedure for men after Botox,"" said  Dr. Chris Bustamante  of New York City. The “you, but better” aesthetic is one that appeals to people regardless of gender, and supports an idea that your looks are something you can and should optimize. Moreover, there’s less of a stigma attached to this idea than in previous generations, since how we present ourselves in culture is seen as a mark of our overall success. And although the average man isn’t in the movies, he likely still has to appear on a screen sometimes, whether in his professional or social life. “Male breast tissue and recalcitrant areas of soft tissue excess around the midsection can be safely and effectively treated with cosmetic surgery.” Girth enhancement Girth enhancement, or the injection of hyaluronic acid into the penis for a fuller look, is a booming enterprise for  Bustamante. “We’re doing about three to four penis filler treatments a day, making this our fastest-growing procedure,” he said. Bustamante noted that it’s important to remember that “ women are bombarded with beauty ads every second of every day.” Men, on the other hand, he suggested, don’t face the same thing, at least not as much. “Men are more streamlined in regards to aesthetic procedures,” he said. “They have more breathing room.” But this is likely to change, if the rise in plastic surgery in the population as a whole is anything to go by.

The NLRB officials allege in a complaint filed Wednesday that SpaceX interrogated workers about the letter and pressured them not to distribute it, according to board spokesperson Kayla Blado. The letter had directly criticized Musk’s behavior on social media. Advertisement The complaint also claims the company “invited employees to quit” and threatened them with termination for exercising their rights, Blado said. SpaceX, which is based in Hawthorne, California, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. It is against the law for employers to retaliate against workers for exercising “protected concerted activity,” or banding together with other workers in hopes of improving their working conditions. The workers who were allegedly retaliated against had criticized Musk's behavior on Twitter, now known as X. via Associated Press The charges submitted to the labor board alleged that after firing five workers, SpaceX continued a “campaign of retaliation and intimidation,” including “coercive interrogations” that led to another three terminations. They also said that during interviews, management showed workers screenshots from private Signal chat groups, making them believe they were being watched. One of the fired workers  told  The New York Times in November that “it was hard for me to believe what was happening, it was so brazen.”  Musk, the CEO of electric-vehicle manufacturer Tesla, created SpaceX in 2002 with the aspiration of one day sending people to Mars. He purchased X, then known as Twitter, in 2022 for $44 billion.

Not moving your body enough or sitting for too long can help reduce cognitive impairment and dementia risk. Poor social health can overstimulate the body’s stress response.","Dementia is the loss of memory, language, problem-solving and other abilities that require thinking. “Dementia is a group of conditions characterized by impairment of at least two brain functions, such as judgment and memory loss,” explained Blair Steel, a psychologist at Carrara Treatment, Wellness & Spa. Your age, family history, race and ethnicity, heart health and history of a traumatic brain injury  are all factors that increase your risk of developing the condition . Read on to learn more about them below: Not moving your body enough or sitting for too long Exercising ― aerobic exercise, especially ―  can help reduce cognitive impairment and dementia risk . Steel said “being inactive does a number on the brain.” Just like other muscles, a good thing to remember is, “If you don’t use it, you lose it.” Not socializing enough Social health  plays a role  in the development of dementia; an active and socially integrated lifestyle can protect against the disease. Stimulating the brain with social interaction is important for everyone, especially as they age. Though, in the age of social media, socializing has become a broader term. Advertisement “We spend a lot of hours on social media, however this likely does not stimulate the brain’s experience of connection as much as socializing in person,” Steel explained. Poor social health  can overstimulate the body’s stress response through increased levels of the stress hormone cortisol, raise blood pressure and decrease blood flow to vital organs amongst other health issues. (Let’s face it, sleep tends to be put on the back burner.) Unfortunately, sleep patterns in earlier life may contribute to later problems.

Being chronically stressed  According to the Alzheimer’s Society , stress is linked to dementia because when you’re stressed and cortisol is released, it can create problems with your memory.

Certain medical conditions like diabetes or heart disease can lead to increased urine production. Treatments for this problem include medication to relax and shrink the prostate or surgical procedures to open it up.","And it’s true: A host of changes happen to your body as you get older, including bladder issues. While urinary incontinence affects people differently ―  especially with age  ―  there are a few explanations for why you may experience this. Here’s what to know: You’re experiencing a decline in estrogen. “As a result, women do not experience the typical telltale signs of a UTI ― such as pain ― but will most likely experience frequent urination.”  Advertisement Your bladder is smaller. Have you ever thought to yourself, “I feel like my bladder has gotten smaller”? “If the colon and rectum are full of poop, this actually can put pressure on your bladder, causing it to feel like you have more urgency to pee,” Reardon said. Addressing constipation with  exercise , dietary fiber, hydration and proper pooping mechanics can actually help your bladder urgency. As you age,  the likelihood of having chronic illnesses and taking multiple medications increases. “Certain medical conditions like diabetes or heart disease can lead to increased urine production,” said Dr.  Anat Sapan , board certified OB-GYN and menopause expert. “ Similarly, many medications, such as diuretics commonly used for high blood pressure, can increase urinary frequency.” You’re consuming too much caffeine. As men age, the prostate naturally increases in size, squeezing the urethra so that instead of peeing through a fire hose, you’re peeing through a cocktail straw instead. “Over time, because the bladder is ‘working out’ so much, it becomes thicker and more spastic, which can cause overactive bladder and frequency of urination.”  Advertisement Treatments for this problem include medication to relax and shrink the prostate or surgical procedures to open it up. According to the  Center for Disease Control and Prevention , Type 2 diabetes most often develops in people over age 45. A common symptom of  Type 2 diabetes  is frequent urination, which might explain the need to pee more as you get older. They can run tests to figure out the culprit and find you some relief.

But it’s still important to prioritize movement during this time of year, said  Dr. Johanna Contreas , a member of the National Hispanic Medical Association and a cardiologist at Mount Sinai Health System in New York. “Winter months, we tend to see an increase in cardiovascular disease and heart attacks and heart failure, hospitalization,” Contreas said, “because those winter months, you’re more indoors, less likely to be active. So, we always try to tell patients: Think about ways that you can remain active.” Advertisement In other words, your version of exercise does not have to take the form of an outdoor run or walk. Daniel de la Hoz via Getty Images Making small adjustments to your cooking regimen can create meaningful change — like not eating meat one day a week, or mixing cauliflower in with your rice. When talking about “numbers,” experts are referring to things like a person’s blood pressure, cholesterol and fasting glucose, said  Dr. Elizabeth Jackson , director of the cardiovascular outcomes and effectiveness research program at the University of Alabama at Birmingham Medicine. Jackson also recommends “knowing your fasting glucose, because we know that in the U.S. we have a high prevalence of diabetes, but we also have a high prevalence of pre-diabetes — people who are not quite meeting the definition of diabetes, but they’re not in the normal range.” According to Johns Hopkins Medicine , having diabetes makes you two to four times more likely to develop cardiovascular disease. According to Jackson, thinking wholeheartedly about your diet is a good goal for the new year. The American Heart Association  has recipes , she noted, that can help maintain or improve your cardiac health. Contreas noted that it’s important to be mindful of your salt intake, too. It’s recommended that adults get between  seven and nine hours of sleep each night . “We don’t have to go and be perfect every day right away,” Jackson said. Additionally, it’s OK to let yourself have rest days (your body needs them!) “But, knowing that if you’re putting in more healthy-type behaviors — healthy diet, physical activity, good sleep — most days, or more than you were, then that’s contributing,” Jackson said.

Grounding skills can lower the heart rate and bring on a state of ease that just isn't there during an anxiety tailspin. If these behaviors are affecting your anxiety regularly, it's time to see a therapist.","Most of us would choose not to  experience  it if we could. That smoke detector alerts you to actual danger and allows you to get out of your home safely, but it also alerts you to things that aren’t actually dangerous, like how a smoke alarm can go off over a piece of burnt toast. Advertisement Similarly, “that threat detection part of our brain... might go off at what it perceives as a threat, but it’s not truly dangerous to us,” Reynolds said. Additionally, common thoughts, behaviors and actions make your anxiety smoke alarm go off more frequently than it should. This kind could mean looking at situations as good or bad and not considering the gray areas, Reynolds explained. Advertisement “So, for example ... if I made an error in an email, this must mean I’m incompetent, and the other person thinks this too,” she said. Avoidance Speaking of stopping something altogether, therapists say this is another habit that can have a negative effect on you. 1 behavior, I believe, that makes anxiety worse is avoidance,” said  Jennifer Anders , a Colorado-based psychologist who runs  The.Anxiety.Doc  Instagram account. “If the worst-case scenario were to play out, what are your strengths in coping with it that we might be underestimating in that moment, as well?” Reynolds said. The worst-case scenario usually doesn’t happen, but a catastrophizing thought pattern can convince you it will. “This really creates a dynamic of self-neglect, prioritizing everyone else’s wishes and needs above your own, [and] poor boundaries is something else that this leads to,” Anders said.

Grounding skills can lower the heart rate and bring on a state of ease that just isn’t there during an anxiety tailspin. “Like becoming aware of your five senses — taste, touch, sight, smell, sound — and the reason why connecting to our five senses is grounding is because it literally gets us into the present moment,” Grosso said.

If you have had longstanding pain in your muscle, tendon, ligament or joint, pause any physical activities and see a provider right away. Cross-training is beneficial as it improves balance, flexibility, skill and agility.","From broken bones to torn muscles, orthopedic surgeons have seen it all. Oftentimes, a seemingly harmless habit or neglecting your bone health can lead to bodily harm. Pain in your bones and muscles could be an indicator of a possible injury. It can further strain the muscles around your knee joint, leading to a number of overuse injuries, Mehta added. If you have had longstanding pain in your muscle, tendon, ligament or joint, pause any physical activities and see a provider right away. According to Dr.  Elizabeth G. Matzkin , a board-certified orthopedic surgeon and chief of women’s sports medicine at Brigham and Women’s Hospital, lifting without proper form can lead to injury. According to both Matzkin and Mehta, one of the habits they personally never do is skip cross-training. Cross-training ― combining exercises to workout various parts of the body ― is beneficial as it improves balance, flexibility, skill and agility. It also prevents overuse injuries, which happens when too much stress is placed on one part of the body. “There’s literally no point to doing surgery on a patient if they will skip physical therapy post-operation,” Mehta said. Not doing physical therapy post-op can lead to the buildup of scar tissue, Matzkin said. When it comes to recovering after surgery, physical therapy can help with pain, swelling and inflammation. Even though you can initially discuss it with your primary care provider, make sure to also visit an orthopedic surgeon who can discuss a range of specialized treatments with you to improve your quality of life. “Orthopedic surgeons could intervene at any given point during the process especially when non-operative management failed to improve symptoms and the patient’s quality of life has been dramatically affected,” said Dr.  Mengnai Li , a board-certified orthopedic surgeon and associate professor at Yale School of Medicine.

She claims that over 40 years ago, Berger secretly used his own sperm to impregnate her during fertility treatment. Depoian visited Berger in 1980 seeking fertility services. She alleges Berger misrepresented the sperm source, suggesting it would be from an unknown medical resident resembling her husband, a common practice before sperm banks, according to Dr. Alyssa Burgart, a bioethics expert from Stanford. Instead, Berger allegedly used his own sperm without Depoian’s consent. This resulted in the birth of Depoian’s daughter, Carolyn Bester, in January 1981.

She never fathomed he would misuse his position of trust in such a violating manner. Boston IVF stated Berger retired in 2020.

Man United paid a whooping £500,000-a-week to get him off the hands of arsenal and have Mkhitaryan move to the opposite club. Sanchez’s move turned into a nightmare as he flopped at Old Trafford and joined Inter Milan in August 2019. After his move to Italy, Sanchez turned his temporary stay to permanent which became awkward for Ole Gunnar. Ole Gunnar has promised that Sanchez will come back to old Trafford and prove his doubters wrong. The promise won’t be happening anymore after his latest statement concerning his transfer. In a video that was posted on  Instagram , the 31-year-old admitted he wanted to tear up his contract at manchester united and return to Arsenal after his training session with the club. Alexis Sanchez discovered quickly that he won’t enjoy his stay in Manchester as he noticed the lack of unity in the club. Alexis Sanchez Video comments In the video Sanchez said, after the first training session, I noticed many things and went back home. I asked my agent if I could cancel the contract and move back to the arsenal. “They started laughing and I told them something was not right with me. The contract has been signed already. “It had never happened to me before as a player. “Months went by and the feelings never died, we were not united as a team at that time. “Journalists also made statements without knowing and it hurts. “Former players spoke about it but had no idea what was going on in the club, and they hurt me. “We were not like that, and it showed on the field. If there was someone to be blamed, they will blame me.

The “ Transformers ” star, who was  reportedly  confirmed Sunday by Bishop Robert Barron, was celebrated Tuesday in a  Facebook  post by the  Capuchin Franciscans’ Western American Province . LaBeouf was shown smiling alongside robed friars, who were “overjoyed” at his decision. “We are thrilled to share that our dear friend Shia LaBeouf has fully entered the Church this past weekend through the sacrament of confirmation! Advertisement Elsewhere, the post went on to say that LaBeouf’s decision to join the church “is a testament to his sincere desire to grow in his relationship with God and live out the Gospel values.” “As Capuchin Franciscans, we believe in the transformative power of faith and the incredible impact it can have on one’s life. We are humbled and grateful to walk alongside Shia as he takes this important step in his spiritual journey.” LaBeouf was born to a Christian father and Jewish mother; he was both baptized as a child and had a bar mitzvah at 13. In a 2022 interview , LaBeouf told Bishop Barron his Jewish faith “felt fake” because he never properly “invested” in it and was largely committed to the teachings because his grandmother wanted him to.

Richard Shotwell/Invision/Associated Press In May 2023, LaBeouf  told ChurchPOP  he was enrolled in the Rite of Christian Initiation of Adults and had seven months left to be confirmed into the church. His conversion in 2022, meanwhile, notably arrived after a string of harrowing allegations against him. LaBeouf  was accused in late 2020  by his ex-girlfriend,  FKA Twigs , of “relentless abuse” that allegedly included sexual battery, assault and emotional distress. The actor  told The New York Times  at the time that he has “no excuses” for his alcoholism, “only rationalizations.” Advertisement “I have been abusive to myself and everyone around me for years,” he said.

She pointed out that “this isn’t the first time” the former South Carolina governor has been a “hypocrite” on race. But she also did this after nine Black churchgoers were murdered in Charleston in 2015 by an avowed racist and had previously dismissed the issue of the flag, suggesting its presence wasn’t a big deal. “When she took it down, she said, ‘For many people in our state, the flag stands for traditions that are noble. “So you can kiss my grits when you try to say some nonsense about how you ‘should’ve said slavery, everybody knows slavery.’ She didn’t say it intentionally because 85% of Republicans are white and she does not want to lose those votes.” Haley’s remarks that the Confederate flag represent noble traditions and Southern heritage are nothing new. It was an attempt to show the South’s role, and the deaths of thousands of Confederate soldiers, in a more positive light, according to  National Geographic . The Confederate flag, however, wasn’t a popular way to boast of Southern pride until “the 1940s and 1950s as part of a massive resistance campaign against the civil rights movement,”  Matthew Guterl , a professor of Africana and American studies at Brown University, told  The Washington Post  in 2015. Advertisement “It wouldn’t exist in our national popular culture without this moment,” Guterl said. “When African Americans fought for their equality … the battle flag was recovered and redeployed as a symbol of opposition to it.” He added: “What was once a very blatant, full-throated defense of white supremacy has now become this gesture to heritage and history that is presented as though it has nothing to do with the civil rights movement.

The villain in this movie also wears a twisted-looking Mickey Mouse mask that vaguely resembles Ghostface’s in the “Scream” movies. If that seems like a stretch, a character in the trailer literally says:  “Like, if he was in a horror movie, you’d never say, ‘I’ll be right back.’ Because then you don’t.” In the original  1996 “Scream” movie, a character says the line :  “Never ever ever under any circumstances say ‘I’ll be right back’ because you won’t be back.” Advertisement The idea to model a murderous Mickey after Ghostface may seem a bit lazy, but it makes sense if you want to slap together a trailer quickly enough to release it the same day the copyright on the “Steamboat Willie” film expired. LMPC via Getty Images Creators are only allowed to use “the more mischievous, rat-like, non-speaking boat captain” featured in “Steamboat Willie” in their work, according to copyright law,  The Associated Press  reported. So, modeling a murder-happy Mickey that’s not allowed to talk after the mostly silent Ghostface — who rarely speaks in person and usually makes his legendary quips over the phone — creates a nice loophole. “Mickey’s Mouse Trap” isn’t the only “Steamboat Willie” horror offering we’re going to get, either. Director Steven LaMorte is set to work on an untitled horror-comedy based on “Steamboat Willie” that will start production in the spring,  Variety  reported. But this time the “sadistic mouse will torment a group of unsuspecting ferry passengers.”    This is also not the first time filmmakers have had the idea to turn a beloved children’s character into a horror movie villain as soon as it becomes public domain.

Captain David Warner will miss the match after losing his baggy green cap. Australia will go in with an unchanged XI, backing their senior players to get the job done. World Test Championship points are still on the line.","“Warner Week has started,” said Australian captain Patrick Cummins. Had Pakistan squared the series 1-1 by converting their chances to win in Melbourne, then the retirement of a cricketing fixture after 112 Tests would have had to share billing with this match being a decider. That much was evident from Cummins’ press conference, where he fielded 13 questions about Warner compared to 11 questions about anything else. And that was before Warner went public with the tale that his baggy green cap had been either lost or stolen in transit from Melbourne, prompting an invitation from Schapelle Corby to swap notes about experiences with Qantas baggage handlers. Somehow he has always found a way to become the story. New cap or not, Australia will need a performance from Warner for reasons beyond symbolism, hoping he can turn on the runs one more time at the venue where he once raided Pakistan for a century by lunch on day one. World Test Championship points are still on the line for this match, and as Cummins pointed out, Australia has already had some deducted for slow over rates in England. Not that this has made them speed up their work on the field since, mind you. Hence Australia will go in with an unchanged XI, backing their senior players to get the job done, and lucky to have their three first-choice fast bowlers fit and firing. “All three of us are really fresh,” said Cummins. It’s all gone pretty smoothly so far.” And hence Pakistan spent the day arguing over changes. Their captain Shan Masood arrived at his press conference half an hour late, delayed by debates over team selection that still weren’t resolved by that point, with a team being announced several hours later. Largely this involved keenness to include the chaos factor of leg-spinner Abrar Ahmed, who has taken bags of wickets in his half dozen matches since debuting a year ago, though often at a heavy cost of runs. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to  Australia Sport Free newsletter Get a daily roundup of the latest sports news, features and comment from our Australian sports desk Privacy Notice:  Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties. after newsletter promotion Desperate for a cutting edge, and tempted by the memory of Sydney as a spin venue, Pakistan wanted to give him every chance to recover from injury, but eventually had to give that up. India back in 2004 led the way with 705 for 7 declared. Local curators have been working this season to add some pep to their Sheffield Shield pitches, and the Test strip the day before the game did have appealing patches of green grass, but that has happened before and proved to be an illusion. Saim was listed to open by the Pakistan board’s press release, but it’s just as likely that he will bat in the middle order with Masood to open. Warner’s best farewell, said Cummins, “would be a hundred and maybe a leg spinner to take the last wicket of the game out of the rough.” He did mean a delivery bowled by Warner, an unlikely prospect given Warner hasn’t sent down an over in a Test match since 2016, but the phrase could equally be read to mean any leg-spin bowler.

The Spurs have struggled this season without a true point guard in their starting lineup. Wemby and Scoot Henderson are slated to face off again in Texas on 26 January.,"Unless your name is  Magic Johnson , the first year of one’s career portends struggle, heartbreak and mistakes aplenty. It’s about what one does with those hard times that matters most. “Just try not to skip any steps – and coach,” said Popovich when asked what it takes to build his roster and No 1 pick into a winner ahead of Thursday night’s game. I feel like the game is kind of slowing down for him. And he’s studying more and more.” While the two rooks have long roads ahead, there has already been a great deal of praise for what they can do as young stars in the league. On Halloween night, Wemby  dueled with all-timer Kevin Durant  and the Phoenix Suns, coming out victorious for one of San Antonio’s few wins this year. “[Like] what’s an appropriate time for a three, and not,” Pop noted. But the team’s biggest problem is that it doesn’t have a true point guard in its starting lineup, with no player on the team averaging more than five assists per game. Wemby, who is listed at 209lbs, also needs to put on weight, some say. “He’s obviously a generational player,” former Spurs head coach Bob Hill told the Guardian. While Thursday saw him score his career high with 25 points, he was also responsible for six turnovers in the game, which opened with a 28-6 Spurs run in the first quarter. Wembanyama didn’t help that cause Thursday, notching seven blocks, including several on Scoot’s attempts. It’s worth noting, too, that Wemby and Henderson aren’t the only two standout rookies this year. 2 pick in the latest draft, is averaging about 15 points per game and Oklahoma City’s star center Chet Holmgren, who sat out last year due to injury, is averaging better than 17 points and nearly three blocks and eight rebounds per game in his first official year—doing it on a winning team. After hitting the hook, Wemby followed it up quickly with a made three-pointer. My confidence [is] still the same, I think, just more [of it]. Just me getting more comfortable with the reps.” And how might he look to continue his progress? So, continue to chop at it and get better.” Henderson, who could easily be mistaken for a Marvel superhero if dropped into some other context, says his “ability to fly [up court], speed, strength, all that” have also taken leaps and bounds. Coach Popovich says he’s on a mandated minutes restriction and he can’t play back-to-backs for a couple of weeks until the team takes another look at his foot. But while fans didn’t get to see Wemby and Scoot take the court together for a second straight night on Friday, the two are slated to  match up again in Texas  on 26 January.",2024-01-02 09:00:55,"[0.0617829377469183, 0.07833846580534468, 0.04964433842591844, 0.9927670273208237, 0.04466567480127562]",,Victor-Wembanyama-and-Scoot-Henderson-clash-offers-peek-at-NBAs-future.wav

Newcastle have lost seven of the past eight games. The Magpies travel to Sunderland in the FA Cup third round on Saturday. Eddie Howe's side also face Manchester City and Aston Villa in January.,"The rain fell incessantly over Anfield as  Liverpool  and Newcastle staged a madcap contest that ended with Eddie Howe staring at January being the cruellest month for his job prospects. This was  a 4-2 shellacking  from Jürgen Klopp’s side that might have been 8-2. Put another way: the football project of Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund has lost seven of the past eight and their next three scheduled outings before February arrives appear as treacherous as this trip to Anfield. On Saturday it is the half-hour drive to Sunderland in the FA Cup third round ahead of league fixtures against Manchester City (home) and Aston Villa (away). Being knocked out of the last competition Newcastle can claim this season by their fiercest rivals at their ground would cause alarm in the plush offices of Howe’s paymasters. Go down or draw when the champions are in town (13 January) and at Villa (30 January), who are three points behind Liverpool after this victory, and Howe would be staring at one win in 11 matches. This is not the form of an upwardly mobile team owned by a nation state whose wish is to burnish their global reputation by transforming Newcastle into a continental heavyweight. At the break Howe and his men could still dream of beginning 2024 with the right result, but this was only because Liverpool produced a curate’s egg of a first half. The poor part was how they failed to end it three or four ahead. The statistic that crystallised this was the 18 shots of Klopp’s side with no goals: their most in eight years in an opening 45 minutes without scoring. Newcastle’s players look dejected after Curtis Jones puts Liverpool 2-1 up.

This was two years before Kevin Keegan’s infamous “I will love it” rant in 1995-96, the last season Newcastle were serious contenders. Coming into this game Howe’s mood music had been odd. He was hinting this was because of those missing but as the world’s richest club there is not, surely, copious sympathy out there for an injury list added to by Kieran Trippier and Callum Wilson being unable to travel. This put those unavailable into double figures but Howe could still send out an XI that featured Alexander Isak as a striker (in Wilson’s position, he equalised) and the impressive Tino Livramento at right-back (Trippier’s). skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to  Football Daily Free daily newsletter Kick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of football Privacy Notice:  Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties. after newsletter promotion After only four minutes the pass count was 28-2 to Liverpool and close to seven were needed before Newcastle had the ball in Liverpool territory.

Introduced in April 2019, the decree had a profound effect on Serie A, reducing the tax burden for teams signing players from abroad by as much as 50%. The changes will not apply retrospectively, so there is no impact on players already under contract. His Inter counterpart, Beppe Marotta, called it an “own goal” for Italian football.

Uefa’s homegrown player rule reserves four of 25 spots in each team’s squad for those trained by the club for at least three years between the ages of 15 and 21. Italiano was rotating his squad to keep legs fresh through a long campaign but by the end of the season had begun to give Ranieri opportunities in Serie A too. “When you get lovely stories like this, all the credit belongs to the player, who arrived here with great humility and a spirit of sacrifice,” said Italiano on Sunday. Local media speculated that Ranieri must have done enough to be considered for a call-up from Luciano Spalletti, the Italy manager. Centre-back is a position of relative strength for Italy – with Alessandro Bastoni and Giorgio Scalvini both emerging as exceptional talents – but, as Ranieri’s past year at Fiorentina shows, it never hurts to give yourself another option.

Posted by Ash October 27, 2023 Posted in Digitalisation In this week’s edition of how this can benefit my brand, I’m here to provide you with the following insights meeting the needs of the Instagram algorithm Mistakes to avoid on X to optimise reach How to optimise the features on TikTok to grow your brand How to utilise efficient ways to maximise your brand on YouTube Now that’s how you match the needs of IGs algorithm Collaborative Instagram post by the tntsportsufc & tntsports Instagram accounts Ahead of #UFC294, TNT Sports decided to get some of their finest journalists and reporters to do a fun challenge with regards to getting their audience to pick their favourite attributes of fighters What this does from a fan engagement perspective is encourage comments fans to send the content pieces to their friends to share their opinions/thoughts alongside it being an advocational avenue to promoting fighters Plus, this can also be repurposed across other social channels, such as creating a TikTok challenge, X thread etc. Therefore, if you’re a fan-generated content account, utilise tactics like this to grow your brand identity. Mistakes to avoid on X, demonstrated by Khamzat Chimaev When making a post on X, when you begin a post with another username @ address, this will register the post as a reply rather than a post, which can have a detrimental effect on your X SEO from a single post Therefore, when making an X post that directly addresses someone like Borz has done, place something in front of it so that you receive as much leverage as possible. For example, a full stop, an emoji representing your brand identity, etc. How can you optimise your TikTok marketing tactics from a branding perspective Instagram reel promoting the England TikTok account screen recorded via Record It. When optimising your brand, it’s important to remain open-minded towards other industries such as football, entertainment, music, etc. Simply because sport is a global entertainment business that has many audiences that crossover from different demographics For that reason, there are plenty of insights we can learn from England football regarding how they’ve optimised their TikTok marketing methods to meet the needs and wants of the algorithm If we pay meticulous attention to detail to how their highlight grid looks, it’s got the TikTok customised thumbnails for the majority of their content alongside pictures of their sponsors and the colours of their kit, which straight away establishes a brand identity for anyone visiting their profile Therefore, when it comes towards utilising branded content across channels such as Instagram or TikTok, which have very similar formats, ensure that you use consistent colour codes and features to meet the needs and wants of their algorithms to ensure your content gets ranked as highly as possible to reach the audiences you desire Stephen ‘Wonderboy’ Thompson demonstrates how repurposing advocational content can work in your favour YouTube video uploaded by Stephen ‘Wonderboy’ Thompson Following an extravagant event last weekend at #UFC294, many athletes have shared their opinions/views/thoughts about Islam Mackhachev’s astonishing finish on Alexander Volkanovski The finish was a crosskick to Volk’s temple, which will be a highlight reel for Islam for the remainder of his career. Now Wonderboy has capitalised on this through his YouTube channel by analysing the move alongside doing his usual breakdowns of karate tutorials and kickboxing tutorials from an educational standpoint, as that is the core theme of his YouTube channel If you’re an upcoming fighter, it’s certainly worth paying attention to big events and focusing on adapting your niche to promote your brand in a fashion that remains authentic to your values That’s enough from me, is there anything that I’ve missed out on?

Posted by Ash October 20, 2023 Posted in Combat Content wrap-up In this weeks edition, we dive into the following How to adapt to changes in X Optimising fight announcements Creative ways to become your own self-promoter How to merge vertical and landscape content efficiently on different platforms The Lionesses lead by example on how to promote a blog post on X Following changes made from Twitter evolving to X, a big adjustment has been being able to view how to promote blog posts as Twitter was very clear around a blog thumbnail being clear as day, whereas now, the format just appears as a graphic, meaning you need to go the extra mile to get your audience to click through A simple ‘click here to read more’ typography graphic through the blog post is enough to encourage Lionesses fans to click through, and it’s something that combat sports brands can learn, too Get people talking around your fight announcements Fight announcement for Jake Paul promoted by the betr IG account Regarding fight announcements, it’s important to be as creative as possible to get more individuals drawn in. Jake Paul and his team have done this by announcing he’s got a fight on the 15th of December but not officially announcing his opponent. I know what you’re thinking: what impact does this make online? Well, it will get communities talking and guessing around who his potential opponent will be, meaning that Jake will likely be trending more across discussion-orientated social channels such as X. Plus, analysts and fan accounts will likely create content on YouTube predicting who his opponent will be. This skill is transferable for fight announcements and any kind of announcement you have, encouraging discussion and debate whenever producing social media content. Get creative with how you promote yourself TikTok reel from Ashley Rak-Su Following KSI vs Tommy Fury, crossover boxer Ashley Rak-Su has devised a rap summarising the highlights from the event. One thing that TikTok certainly appreciates is creative content; therefore, utilise that to your advantage. Even in the fight game, you’ll see certain fighters creatively mocking their opponents; for example, when  Crewz-Dezurn had her face-off against Savannah Marshall , she started doing a rap against Savannah, which proved unorthodox and engaging. Plus, stuff like that can get repurposed and recognised by other brands. Ash’s inspirational poem in dedication to Michael Bisping Another example involves my own brand.

SoftBank will own just over half of Monet, the new business, while Toyota will hold the rest. It's the latest in a series of driverless development partnerships announced by tech companies and carmakers. SoftBank's $100 billion Vision Fund, its tech-focused investment arm, had already committed $2.3 billion to General Motors' self-driving car unit GM Cruise. On Wednesday,  Honda   ( HMC )  and  General Motors   ( GM )  said they were teaming up to create a new generation of fully autonomous vehicles. BMW   ( BMWYY )  has joined the board of Apollo, an autonomous driving project from Chinese internet firm  Baidu   ( BIDU ) . Facebook under investigation:  The Irish Data Protection Commission has launched a formal probe into a  Facebook   ( FB )  hack that affected as many as 50 million accounts. The commission will investigate whether the company complied with its obligations under new European data protection laws that came into effect in May. Facebook said last week that it closed the loophole, but 90 million users were forcefully logged out of their accounts as a precaution. Irish regulators are investigating because Facebook's international headquarters is in Dublin. There are still many unanswered questions about the hack: Who carried it out? US hiring data published Wednesday was stronger than expected, and momentum could continue Thursday if initial claims numbers add to the optimism. ""The underlying message is that the US economy isn't just in fine fettle, it's on fire,"" said Kit Juckes, strategist at Societe Generale.

At the same time, corporate rate cuts are made permanent under the bill. By 2027 a large majority of people making less than $200,000 will either see little change in their tax bill or a tax increase.","Tax moves to make before 2018   First, the good news. A lot of households under the  GOP tax plan , which President Trump is set to sign into law this week, will see a lower tax bill in the next several years. The nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation estimates that in 2019, more than half of filers making $40,000 and up will see an average tax cut greater than $500. That trend holds for income groups over $50,000    The Tax Institute at H&R Block provided some scenarios of people with young children, for instance, who could see their  tax burden drop  by roughly $2,000    But here's the thing: After 2025, all individual tax cuts are set to expire. At the same time, corporate rate cuts are made permanent under the bill. As a result, by 2027 a large majority of people making less than $200,000 will either see little change in their tax bill or a tax increase relative to what they pay today, the JCT estimates. Related: Try the CNN tax calculator to see how you may fare under GOP bill       Republicans made individual tax cuts temporary so they could meet budget rules that let them pass their tax overhaul with no Democratic votes. But don't worry, they say. A future Congress won't let middle class tax cuts expire. Recent precedents -- like the oft-extended Bush tax cuts -- suggest they may be right. Still, there's zero guarantee of that. After all, a lot can change over eight years. In any case, there's another reason you could end up with a tax increase after 2025. While the cuts are temporary, the GOP tax bill makes permanent another key provision that tax expert Lily Batchelder has described as a ""stealth tax increase"" for individuals, the effects of which will grow over time. The money it will raise is a big reason why the cost of the permanent corporate tax cuts will be paid for in the second decade, according to Batchelder, a tax law professor at New York University. Related: What's in the final GOP tax plan      The GOP plan introduces a new, slower inflation measure called chained CPI that will apply to inflation-adjusted parts of the tax code. So, for example, the income ranges that apply to each of the seven income tax rates will grow more slowly. So will the value of many tax credits and the income phaseout thresholds for various tax breaks. Those thresholds dictate whether you make too much money to qualify for certain breaks. The upshot for tax filers is this: Many tax breaks, Batchelder said,    CNNMoney (New York)    First published December 20, 2017: 4:54 PM ET",2017-12-20 21:54:29,"[0.9517564564610933, 0.080516711043752, 0.2535205034373523, 0.06756060668388843, 0.1372575156000447]",,Enjoy-your-tax-cuts-while-they-last.wav

Plus, some individuals will end up paying even more. The Tax Institute at H&R Block ran a number of scenarios for filers in different situations to give a more specific gauge of where you might stand in 2018 if you're a wage earner. In the next several years, plenty of filers are likely to see a tax cut of some kind, although not everyone will be quite so lucky.

Related: What's in the GOP's final tax plan      Here's just a sampling of how people in different situations may fare next year. Keep in mind, these scenarios do not delve into the more complex provisions of the Republican plan that, for instance, taxes a filer's business income at a lower rate than their wage income. Much more needs to be unpacked by experts as to how that will play out for different filers. Nor do they take into account the potential effects of other provisions in the tax bill -- such as  eliminating the penalty for not buying health insurance  -- or any future spending cuts that may be made to help offset the cost of the tax bill.
